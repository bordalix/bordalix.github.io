    <p>Every 5 seconds there's an onchain transaction:</p>
    <script type="text/typogram">
      {% include txt/ark/diagram.txt %}
    </script>
    <p>
      In this example, Alice, Bob and Carol are "lifting" 1 BTC each to Ark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output is a UTXO locked by a multisig 4 of 4, where 4 is the number of
      participants in the transaction. An alternative tapleaf allows the Server
      to spend it alone after 4 weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resulting UTXO is then used as input for a new transaction. This new
      transaction doesn't need to go onchain, but Alice, Bob and Carol each have
      a copy of it, and they can broadcast it to the network any time to recover
      their BTC.
    </p>
    <script type="text/typogram">
      {% include txt/ark/diagram2.txt %}
    </script>
    <p>Now let's imagine Alice wants to send Eve 1 BTC using Ark:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Alice asks Eve for an address (address E)</li>
      <li>Alice informs Server she wants to pay 1 BTC to address E</li>
      <li>
        Server (with help of E) prepares new transaction (TX2) and show it to
        Alice:
      </li>
      <script type="text/typogram">
        {% include txt/ark/diagram3.txt %}
      </script>
      <li>
        Alice looks at the locking script for this new UTXO and sees Eve's
        public key on it
      </li>
      <li>
        Alice understands that when TX2 confirms, Eve will have 1 BTC on Ark
      </li>
      <li>
        Alice proceeds by sending her VUTXO to the server, on the condition that
        TX2 is confirmed:
      </li>
      <script type="text/typogram">
        {% include txt/ark/diagram4.txt %}
      </script>
      <li>
        Server cannot cheat, if he wants to receive from Alice he needs to send
        it to Eve, which means Alice is paying Eve atomically.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>"only if TX2 is confirmed"</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This condition is not possible to implement today using Bitcoin script,
      but we can implement it using a trick:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        TX1 will have additional outputs, called
        <strong>connectors</strong>
      </li>
      <li>This connectors have no financial value (dust limit)</li>
      <li>Connectors are singlesig spendable by the Server</li>
      <li>
        Alice will use one of this connectors as input to the new transaction
      </li>
      <li>
        Alice will sign her VUTXO with SIGHASH_ALL to commit to all inputs
      </li>
      <li>The Server will sign the connector input</li>
    </ul>
    <script type="text/typogram">
      {% include txt/ark/diagram5.txt %}
    </script>
    <p>
      This way, the TX where Alice gives her VUTXO to the server is only valid
      if TX2 is confirmed.
    </p>
