    <h3>ELI5</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Alice sends money to the bank and in return receives a check from the bank that she can redeem anytime anywhere
        (not only on this bank)
      </li>
      <li>
        If Alice wants to pay Bob using Ark, she can ask the bank to pay Bob, and in return she will endorse their check
        back to the bank.
      </li>
      <li>The bank can only redeem Alice's check if it shows proof of payment to Bob.</li>
      <li>Bob receives a check from the bank that he can redeem anytime anywhere.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>TL/DR</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>There are two parties involved in Ark: users and the Ark Service Provide (ASP) aka Server.</li>
      <li>Ark implements <em>VTXOs</em>, and all values exchanged inside Ark use <em>VTXOs</em>.</li>
      <li>
        <em>VTXOs</em> are outpoints from hidden transactions, that can be broadcasted to mainchain to become
        <em>UTXOs</em>, or sent to the ASP in exchange for other <em>VTXOs</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spending and receiving <em>VTXOs</em> doesn't touch the chain, which allows for an infinite exchange of value
        inside Ark with a minimal chain footprint.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ark is a completely <u>trustless</u> solution: users don't need ASP's permission to get their money back from
        the Ark, and the ASP doesn't need to trust users
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Onboarding</h3>
    <p>
      The first step is for Alice to lift her coins. This is an <u>atomic</u> swap where she will give up a UTXO (+
      fees) to receive a virtual UTXO (aka VTXO) from the ASP at the same time. The ASP makes a special transaction,
      called pool transaction (aka Pool Tx), where it mixes UTXOs from many users (among other things) and creates a
      shared UTXO as well as many off-chain VTXOs for each of those users including one for Alice.
    </p>
    <p>In this example, Alice, Bob, Carol and Dave are "lifting" 0.01 BTC each to Ark:</p>
    <script type="text/typogram">
      {% include txt/ark/onboarding.txt %}
    </script>
    <p>In order to be trustless:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Alice sending funds to ASP and the ASP creating the VTXO needs to be atomic</li>
      <li>Alice needs a way to exit the Ark without ASP's permission</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tech">
      <a onclick="toggleVisibility('#dd1')">ðŸ”Ž Deep dive on onboarding Ark</a>
      <div class="hidden" id="dd1">
        <p><strong>Pool transaction</strong></p>
        <p>
          The ASP places one (or more) input(s) to its pool transaction to supply funds to the shared UTXO output,
          connectors output, change output, and transaction fees.
        </p>
        <script type="text/typogram">
          {% include txt/ark/pooltx1.txt %}
        </script>
        <p>The shared UTXO output is a UTXO locked by 2 taproot leaves:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A multisig <em>n-of-n</em>, where n is the number of participants in the transaction.</li>
          <li>The other leaf, <em>pk(ASP) && older(4 weeks)</em>, allows the ASP to spend it alone after 4 weeks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In order to be trustless, before signing the pool transaction Alice needs a way to unilaterally get their
          funds back. To achieve this, the ASP builds and signs a binary tree of transactions and shares them with each
          participant.
        </p>
        <p>Each leaf on this tree represents a VTXO:</p>
        <script type="text/typogram">
          {% include txt/ark/pooltx2.txt %}
        </script>
        <p>
          In the example above, Alice's VTXO will be <em>tx1:1 => tx2:1 => tx4</em> that she can broadcast anytime to
          receive their funds back. For comparison, Bob's VTXO will be <em>tx1:1 => tx2:0 => tx5</em>.
        </p>
        <p>Notes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Since <em>tx1:1 => tx2:1 => tx4</em> (the VTXO) have no fees, Alice will need to add an extra transaction to
            pay for all the fees (see <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/cpfp/" target="_blank">CPFP</a>).
          </li>
          <li>
            The number of transactions on this branches will be equal to <em>log2(n) + 1</em>, where n = number of
            participants
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For clarity, VTXOs will be represented like this:</p>
        <script type="text/typogram">
          {% include txt/ark/pooltx3.txt %}
        </script>

        <p><strong>Lifting</strong></p>
        <p>
          Frank now wants to enter the Ark, so he must use a process called lifting, which is an atomic two-way peg
          mechanism that doesn't require trust. Lifting lets users lift their on-chain utxos off the chain for a 1:1
          VTXO. Users can unilaterally redeem a VTXO for an on-chain utxo without asking for ASP cooperation.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Frank sends 0.01 BTC to <em>pk(F) && (older(4 weeks) || pk(ASP))</em> (aka funding address):</li>
          <script type="text/typogram">
            {% include txt/ark/lifting1.txt %}
          </script>
          <li>
            Frank creates an PSBT and adds as input the output of funding transaction. We will call this transaction the
            sweep transaction, since it will allow the ASP to sweep the funds:
          </li>
          <script type="text/typogram">
            {% include txt/ark/lifting2.txt %}
          </script>
          <li>Frank passes this PSBT to the ASP</li>
          <li>ASP places one input to PSBT, the "connector output" from the next pool transaction:</li>
          <script type="text/typogram">
            {% include txt/ark/lifting4.txt %}
          </script>
          <li>ASP places one output to PSBT, <em>pk(ASP)</em>, a singlesig output that sweeps all money to itself:</li>
          <script type="text/typogram">
            {% include txt/ark/lifting5.txt %}
          </script>
          <li>
            ASP passes PSBT to Frank and both sign the PSBT and keep this transaction private. This transaction is not
            valid yet, since the connector's outpoint context does not exist yet;
          </li>
          <li>ASP signs the pool transaction and broadcast it:</li>
          <script type="text/typogram">
            {% include txt/ark/lifting7.txt %}
          </script>
          <li>
            ASP can now claim 0.01 BTC from the funding transaction by revealing the descendant transaction of
            connectors output. The ASP should claim this before four weeks or else Frank could double spend it. Don't
            forget the funding transaction is locked to: <em>pk(F) && (older(4weeks) || pk(ASP))</em>.
          </li>
          <script type="text/typogram">
            {% include txt/ark/lifting8.txt %}
          </script>
          <li>
            Frank now has a 0.01 BTC worth UTXO representation as a descendant of the shared UTXO output (a VTXO). To
            avoid double spending, the ASP will not allow Frank to use its <em>VTXO</em> before the funding transaction
            is confirmed:
          </li>
          <script type="text/typogram">
            {% include txt/ark/lifting9.txt %}
          </script>
        </ol>
        <p>So far, Frank polluted onchain by funding an address, and the ASP by claiming funds from that address.</p>
        <p>Further steps from here will be footprint minimal.</p>
        <details>
          <summary>Adversarial scenarios</summary>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Franks send 0.01 BTC but ASP never responds</strong><br />
              Franks will be able to get his funds back in 4 weeks<br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ASP never broadcasts pool transaction</strong><br />
              Franks will be able to get his funds back in 4 weeks<br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ASP doesn't wait for confirmation of funding address before broadcasting pool tx</strong><br />
              Franks will double spend his original UTXO, making the funding transaction invalid and them spending the
              VTXO, thus stealing the ASP<br /><br />
            </li>
          </ul>
        </details>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Payment</h3>
    <p>
      Alice then instructs the ASP to take her VTXO and pay Oscar. She will only need to know Oscar's address. This
      payment is also atomic and private. The ASP does not know which VTXO belongs to which user and blindly mixes them
      to produce another anonymous VTXO set. Ark's magic occurs in the fact that the post-mix VTXOs can only be claimed
      by the intended recipients even though the ASP has no idea who owns them. Put another way, the ASP is simply
      coordinating blind coinjoin rounds.
    </p>
    <p>Now let's imagine Alice wants to send Oscar 0.01 BTC using Ark:</p>
    <script type="text/typogram">
      {% include txt/ark/payment0.txt %}
    </script>
    <p>Alice forfeits its VTXO to the ASP and in return Oscar receives a VTXO</p>
    <div class="tech">
      <a onclick="toggleVisibility('#dd2')">ðŸ”Ž Deep dive on Ark payments</a>
      <div class="hidden" id="dd2">
        <ol>
          <li>Alice asks Oscar for an address (address O)</li>
          <li>Alice informs ASP she wants to pay 0.01 BTC to address O</li>
          <li>ASP (with help of Oscar) prepares new transaction (Pool Tx 2) and show it to Alice:</li>
          <script type="text/typogram">
            {% include txt/ark/payment3.txt %}
          </script>
          <li>Alice looks at the locking script for this new UTXO and sees Oscar's public key on it</li>
          <li>Alice understands that when Pool Tx 2 confirms, Oscar will have 0.01 BTC on Ark</li>
          <li>
            Alice proceeds by signing a PSBT that sends her VTXO to the ASP, on the condition that Pool Tx 2 is
            confirmed. We will call this the forfeit transaction:
          </li>
          <script type="text/typogram">
            {% include txt/ark/payment6.txt %}
          </script>
          <li>
            ASP cannot cheat, if he wants to receive from Alice he needs to send it to Oscar, which means Alice is
            paying Oscar atomically.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>"Only if Pool Tx 2 is confirmed"</strong></p>
        <p>
          This condition is not possible to implement today using Bitcoin script, but we can implement it using a trick:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pool Tx 1 will have additional outputs, called <em>connectors</em></li>
          <li>This connectors have no financial value (dust limit)</li>
          <li>Connectors are singlesig spendable by the ASP (<em>pk(ASP)</em>)</li>
          <li>Alice will use one of this connectors as input to the new transaction</li>
          <li>Alice will sign her VTXO with <em>SIGHASH_ALL</em> to commit to all inputs</li>
          <li>The ASP will sign the connector input</li>
        </ul>
        <script type="text/typogram">
          {% include txt/ark/connector.txt %}
        </script>
        <p>This way, the transaction where Alice gives her VTXO to the ASP is only valid if Pool Tx 2 is confirmed.</p>
        <details>
          <summary>Adversarial scenarios</summary>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Alice doesn't sign the forfeit transaction</strong><br />
              The ASP doesn't include Oscar's VTXO on the next pool transaction<br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ASP never broadcasts the next pool transaction</strong><br />
              ASP forfeit transaction becomes invalid, which means Alice still has full control of her VTXO<br /><br />
            </li>
          </ul>
        </details>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Exiting the Ark</h3>
    <p>
      When Alice wants to exit the Ark, she arranje with the ASP to have an output (<em>pk(Alice)</em>) on the next Pool
      transaction.
    </p>
    <script type="text/typogram">
      {% include txt/ark/exiting0.txt %}
    </script>
    <p>Alice could also unilaterally exit, i.e. without ASP's cooperation by broadcasting her redeem transaction.</p>
    <div class="tech">
      <a onclick="toggleVisibility('#dd3')">ðŸ”Ž Deep dive on exiting the Ark</a>
      <div class="hidden" id="dd3">

        <p><strong>Unilateral exit</strong></p>
        <p>Alice can leave the Ark anytime by broadcasting her redeem transaction.</p>
        <p>The cost of this broadcast depends on several factors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How many transactions are on Alice's branch?</li>
          <li>How much is mempool fees (sats/vbyte) at the moment?</li>
          <li>Did anyone leaved already, making some of Alice's transactions already confirmed?</li>
