title: 'BumpTop, the 3D desktop'
---

<p>Just found <a href="http://bumptop.com">BumpTop</a>, a nice looking 3D desktop, like a real desk, but better. Still not sure if it's good for me, but I always like to see innovative products. Well, actually it's not for me, currently it runs only on the Windows platform, and since I'm a Mac user, I will have to wait to give it a try. But, hey, there are still very good people out there using Windows. Here is the demo video:</p>
