<p>Dear Santa, is me again. I've just watched <a href="http://macworld.apple.com.edgesuite.net/mw/index.html">Steve's keynote</a> (1h32m23s) and I would like to add to my wish list a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">new iMac</a>, with a Intel duo processor inside (2-3 times faster);</li>
  <li>a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a>, also with the Intel beast (4-5 times faster), an iSight built in and a remote controller;</li>
  <li>the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife 06</a>, now with <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/quicktour/iweb/">iWeb</a> (amazing!);</li>
  <li>the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/">iWork</a>;</li>
  <li> and a <a href="http://www.apple.com/dotmac/">.Mac</a> account.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ahh, and a huge, huge one was a real Mac retail store here.</p>
