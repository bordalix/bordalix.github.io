Fresh from ArsTechnica, it seems tomorrow Google will announce a new video service:<br /><blockquote>The service, which will be an addition to Google's Video Search, will allow users to buy video content for pre-determined prices, and the company is expected to announce partnerships with the likes of CBS and the NBA.</blockquote><br />Additionally, Google will announce Google Pack, several applications available for download in a single installation bundle:<br /><blockquote>Sources tell us that Google pack will feature a Google-tweaked version of Firefox, Adobe Acrobat Reader, antivirus software from Symantec, AdAware, Trillian, and Google's own offerings, including Google Desktop Search, Picasa, Google Earth, Google Talk, and all of the toolbar action you can shake a stick at. Oh, and I left out one other item: the RealPlayer.</blockquote><br />You can read the complete article <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060105-5902.html">here</a>
