Everyone is talking about next week (Sept. 7) <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2005/08/20050829163311.shtml">Apple announcement</a>, but no one really knows what is all about. Please take your chances:<br /><br />a) iPod video with iTunes Music Store selling video clips;<br />b) switching iPod Mini to a flash-based technology;<br />c) flash-based larger-capacity Shuffles;<br />d) a totally new category of devices;<br />e) the Motorola iTunes phone;<br />f) a mobile OS.
