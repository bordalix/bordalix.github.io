title: "George W. Bush sings U2"
---

In an amazing audio copy & paste exercise, rx creates new versions of well known musics, all "singed" by George W. Bush. His website is <a href="http://www.thepartyparty.com/">here</a> and my favorite music is "<a href="http://media2.audiostreet.net/playsong.m3u?mode=StreamLo&song=B5FE87B6AB8C442AB6AAB43092F2CFD1">Sunday Bloody Sunday</a>" from U2. What's yours?
