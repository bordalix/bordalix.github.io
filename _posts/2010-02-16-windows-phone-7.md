<p>Ladies and Gents, we have a new contender in the smartphone arena: <a href="http://www.windowsphone7series.com/">Microsoft Phone OS</a>. By the look of it, they choose a clean sheet approach for the new Windows Phone 7, and rebuild it from ground zero. For all of you out there asking, no, it doesn't support Flash, which makes some sense, since Microsoft's Silverlight is a direct competitor to Flash.</p>

<p>All I know about this new OS is what I see in released videos, and I must say it looks good. It looks like Microsoft engineers developed a new way of mobile interaction, but only life usage will tell if is it good or not.</p>

<p>Available in holiday 2010 (whatever that means). Watch the video:</p>
