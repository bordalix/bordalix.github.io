title: "Harry Potter's spoiler t-shirt"
---

<p>Some of my friends are huge Harry Potter fans, and I'm always kidding with them by saying that I will make the worse t-shirt ever: with the information leaked from Harry Potter's last book, I will do a t-shirt telling the end of the saga, and ware it through the sidewalk, in the book launch night. Imagine all the people waiting for twelve o'clock in the cue, and suddenly being confronted with the spoiler. Of course I'm kidding, I would never do a thing like that, I'm not (that) evil, but someone is.</p><p>This guys have made the t-shirt. Fortunately, the launch night has gone, since the temptation would be huge! <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/fashion/29emoticon.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin">>:-)</a></p><p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/harry-rotter/non+magic-spoilsport-t+shirt-reveals-harry-potters-ending-283349.php">Click here to see the t-shirt.</a> <b>Note:</b> spoiler ahead.</p><p><b>Update:</b> It can get more evil than I thought:<blockquote><p>A headteacher caused some distress by reading to about 400 children from the last page of the final Harry Potter book at a primary school in Somerset.</p></blockquote><p>Via a BBC News <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/bristol/somerset/6925622.stm">report</a>.</p>
