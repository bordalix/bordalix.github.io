title: 'The discovery of the century?'
---

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kanzius">John Kanzius</a>, a former broadcast executive, can become the man of century. While experimenting with a machine he had invented to test a new cancer treatment, by using radio waves to destroy tumor cells, he found a way to <strong>burn seawater</strong>.</p>

<p>The big question is if the burning generates more energy than it takes to make the radio waves needed to weaken the bonds that hold water molecules together. Kanzius has admitted that this is currently not the case, but it could be, thus giving birth to the most disruptive discovery of the century.</p>

<p>More details about the process are not known, since Kanzius is applying for a patent, but you can see it working in the following YouTube video:</p>
