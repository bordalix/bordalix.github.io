title: "The website stickiness paradox"
---

<p><b>Update:</b> a <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/01/31/facebook-half-click-throughs/">study conducted  by Webtrends</a> confirms the paradox.</b></p><p>Since the beginning of the world wide web, entrepreneurs and investors strive for high levels of engagement of their website, or what we used to call "stickiness". Time-on-site and page views by unique user are indicators everyone is trying to improve and boost. And that sounds reasonable.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cost per click (CPC) became the dominant advertising model on the web, and paradoxically, it rewards un-sticky websites.</p><p>Think Google: it's probably the more un-sticky website out there, with people spending just a few seconds in it, doing the search, reading the results and jumping out, with Google earning a few cents in the process.</p><p>Now think Facebook: people spend hours on Facebook, and the last think they want to do is to click an ad and go away. It's like going to a bar to socialize and never buy anything. This is why Facebook became the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/03/16/technology/facebook_most_visited/">most visited</a> site in the web, but generates only 1/30 of Google's revenue in paid advertising.</p><p>So, in a nutshell, Facebook's CPC advertising model will not succeed, they will have to think in alternative revenue sources (f-commerce, places, etc.) and webmasters should re-think their web strategy.</p><p>What do you think?</p>
