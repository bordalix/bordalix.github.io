<p><a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a> is a huge success, so every one is trying to make a clone of it. The first one to win a lot of attention was <a href="http://meneame.net">Meneame</a>, a spanish implementation of Digg, since they decided to deliver there code under the GPL license.</p><p>With free code available, it became a simple matter of time for other clones to pop up trough the net like mushrooms. And Portugal is no different: there is at least two new ones, <a href="http://ouvidizer.com">ouvidizer.com</a> and <a href="http://domelhor.net">domelhor.net</a>.</p><p>The latest is <a href="http://pauloquerido.net/">Paulo Querido</a>'s new project, and caught my attention due to some great links I have found there:</p><ul><li>Belgium researchers were able to play the surrounding sound that was present during the painting of a south american vase with more the 5 centuries. You can hear people laughing, watch the <a href="http://www.zalea.org/article.php3?id_article=496">video</a> (in french);</li><br /><li>Following Tetris, Russia give us a new form of addiction, Putin Chess. The <a href="http://ciberia.aeiou.pt/?st=4255">link</a> from domelhor.net points to a portuguese written page, more on Putin Chess <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=putin+chess">here</a>;</li><br /><li>After Segway, Dean Kamen invented two devices, one able to purify 1000 liters of clean water a day, and the other one is a power generator able to make a kilowatt of anything that burns. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/02/16/technology/business2_futureboy0216/index.htm">More</a> on CNN Money.</li></ul><p>As you can see, it adds value, by helping one find news of interest, but the design of any of the webpages can be a lot better. Well, best wishes for everyone.</p>
