title: 'Anti-Sony manifesto'
---

<p>So, Sony installs a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit">rootkit</a> in your PC when you buy a CD from them, in order to implement his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM</a>.</p>

<p>This was <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html">discovered </a>by <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/">Mark Russinovich</a> in October (highly technical post). In my personal opinion, this an unacceptable behavior, and I'm not alone: <a href="http://webreakstuff.com/">Frederico Oliveira</a> wrote what I consider to be the first <a href="http://webreakstuff.com/blog/2005/11/sony-i-download-your-music/">anti-Sony manifesto</a>, which I totally subscribe.</p>
