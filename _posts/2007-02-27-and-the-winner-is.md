<p>Nopes, it's not about Hollywood oscars (elected by some guys nobody cares) but about the free initiative named <a href="http://oscartorrents.com/">Oscar torrents</a>. I really don't know who is behind this, but I really don't care: 133378 voters is a pretty good number for the first edition.</p><p>The film which won more oscartorrent was <a href="http://www.panslabyrinth.com/">Pan's labyrinth</a>, and the oscartorrent for the best picture was to <a href="http://thedeparted.warnerbros.com/">The departed</a>.</p><p>See the list movies and access the torrent files <a href="http://oscartorrents.com/">here</a>.</p><p>The site disclaimer is also a pearl:</p><blockquote>OSCARTORRENTS®, and the OSCAR THE PIRATE® statuette design mark are the unregistered marks of no one in particular. No ©2007. Nothing to do with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences & ABC, Inc. All Rights Reversed. The Official Oscars is a sham produced by villiains in partnership with the cult of celebrity. By accessing this site you're probably comitting a felony somewhere -- but let your own idea of what is right and wrong be your guide.</blockquote><p>Enjoy your movies.</p>
