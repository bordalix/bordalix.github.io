title: "Bye bye TV, hello Joost"
---

I got an invitation for Joost 10 minutes ago. It took me 60 seconds for a 16 MB download, another 30 seconds for extraction and installation, 30 seconds to get the first Joost channel ('Joost Suggests') up and running in full-screen mode, no flicks, good quality, and watch some crazy surfers riding big waves in Hawaii.An additional 3 minutes to see the channel list (pretty impressive, NatGeo, MTV and others) and try and watch other channels. Everything is working smoothly.Now the bad news: my MacBook remote controller didn't work (yes, I know, it isn't supported, but I needed something bad to say).The rest 5 minutes were to write this post.
