title: "WiFi from Google"
---

Business 2.0 is saying that <a href="http://www.business2.com/b2/web/articles/0,17863,1093558-1,00.html">Google will give free Wi-Fi access to everyone in the EUA</a>. The money is in targeting advertising to a user's precise location, and in saving some million dollars per month in interconnection fees. So, Google is giving amazing search capabilities (with is search engine), advertising for everyone (with AdSense), huge storage capacity (with Gmail), and now, going down the OSI layer, access to everyone. Should we change the name from Internet to GoogleNet?
