title: "Content-aware image sizing"
---

<p>The following video demonstrates a software application that resizes images in such a way that the content of the image is preserved intelligently. The basic idea is that if you want to stretch out an image, it will keep the key elements of the photo in sensible places while filling in less important areas. The same goes for shrinking an image - it will eliminate the less important features of an image and leave the main subject areas intact and in the same relative location as they previously appeared in the image.</p><p>This is the work of <a href="http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/">Dr. Ariel Shamir</a> from <a href="http://www.idc.ac.il/cs">Efi Arazi School of Computer Science</a>.</p><iframe title="Content-aware image sizing" width="480" height="300" data-src="//www.youtube.com/embed/c-SSu3tJ3ns" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>RSS readers should click <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2007/08/23/content-aware-image-sizing">here</a> to watch the movie.</p><p>Via <a href="http://www.fabiopedrosa.info/">FÃ¡bio Pedrosa</a>.
