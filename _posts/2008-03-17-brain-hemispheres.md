title: 'Brain hemispheres'
---

<p>Another great Ted talk, this time from neuroanatomist Jill Bolte Taylor which had a great opportunity for a brain scientist:</p>

<blockquote>One morning, she realized she was having a massive stroke. As it happened -- as she felt her brain functions slip away one by one, speech, movement, understanding -- she studied and remembered every moment. This is a powerful story about how our brains define us and connect us to the world and to one another</blockquote>

<p>It's a very strong, emotional story, explaining the differences between our right and left brain hemispheres, told in the first person.</p>
