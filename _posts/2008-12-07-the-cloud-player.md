<p>The year is yet to begin, and the app to watch for in 2009 has just popped out: <a href="http://www.thecloudplayer.com/">The Cloud Player</a>, a "iTunes in the cloud" with friends sharing music. It's a all new ball game for the music industry, a brand new way of listening to music. Don't you love these spikes of evolution? Did I mention it's open source?</p>
