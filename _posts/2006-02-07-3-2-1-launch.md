After 2 weeks of design, coding and others, joaobordalo.com is now officially launched. This will be a evolving site, with new features and functionalities being added across the time. I intend to use it as my <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> test bed, so put your fingers crossed.<br><br>All posts from <a href="http://alinobairro.blogspot.com/">alinobairro</a> had been migrated here, but comments were not, and I'm still in the process of adding tags to the older posts.<br><br>This site will be more than a blog, but for now, it's just a blog and a couple of pages (see the upper left corner).<br><br>Please take a look at it, try it, and give me some feedback by commenting to this post. Thank you.
