<p>The new Blaukpunkt's TravelPilot 700 is a beast: it features an integrated camera that displays realtime video with navigation overlays on their screen, traffic sign recognition, TV via DVB-T (while you are not driving), voice control, web and emails via wi-fi, traffic information which re-routes to avoid traffic congestions and the (already) usual bluetooth integration with your cellphone. Additionally, it comes with a speed camera warning, which I'm not sure if it's legal in the UE.</p><p>Watch the video below and see for yourself:</p><iframe title="The GPS from the future" width="480" height="300" data-src="//www.youtube.com/embed/2QxBlonVHnk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>This is a all new ball game, it's time for TomTom, Garmin and such to speed up development and close the gap.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm not affiliate with Blaukpunkt, I'm just looking for cutting edge technology.</p><p>RSS readers should click <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2008/09/02/the-gps-from-the-future">here</a> to watch the video.</p>
