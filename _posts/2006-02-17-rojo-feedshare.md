<p>Recently, Rojo lunched a new service, called <a href="http://www.rojo.com/corporate/services/feedshare">FeedShare</a>, which enables bloggers with similar interests to  promote each other. The ideia works something like this: you add a banner on your blog promoting other blogs, and they do the same. See some screenshots and a more detailed explanation in <a href="http://www.rojo.com/corporate/services/feedshare">Feedshare page</a>.</p>
