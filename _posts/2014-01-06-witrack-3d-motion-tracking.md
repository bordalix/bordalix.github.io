---

<p><a href="http://witrack.csail.mit.edu/">WiTrack</a> is a device that tracks the 3D motion of a user from the radio signals reflected off her body. It works even if the person is occluded from the WiTrack device or in a different room.</p><p>WiTrack localizes the center of a human body to within 10 to 13 cm in the x and y dimensions (about the size of an adult hand), and 21 cm in the z dimension. It also provides coarse tracking of body parts, identifying the direction of a pointing hand with a median of 11.2 degrees. </p><p>Great for gaming, controlling household appliances and elderly monitoring & fall detection.</p><p>Watch the video and be amazed with the accuracy:</p><iframe width="480" height="300" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/sbFZPPC7REc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
