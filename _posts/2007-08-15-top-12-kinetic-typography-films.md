title: 'Top 12 kinetic typography films'
---

<p>Back on February, I posted one <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2007/02/26/pulp-fiction-in-typography">article about a Pulp Fiction dialog</a>, presented with moving typography, perfectly synchronized with the text, with a lot of funny and creative details.</p>

<p>Later, I found out this presentation technique was named <strong>kinetic typography</strong>, and that is being explored in the School of Design at CMU since 1996, by <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~johnny/">Johnny Lee</a> under the direction of <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~hudson/">Scott Hudson</a> and <a href="http://goodgestreet.com/">Jodi Forlizzi</a>.</p>

<p>But, after all, what is the definition of <a href="http://kinetictypography.org/">kinetic typography</a>?</p>

<blockquote>Kinetic typography refers to the art and technique of expression with animated text. Similar to the study of traditional typography of designing static typographic forms, kinetic typography focuses on understanding the effect time has on the expression of text. Kinetic typography has demonstrated the ability to add significant emotive content and appeal to expressive text, allowing some of the qualities normally found in film and the spoken word to be added to static text.</blockquote>

<p>In the meantime, I've collected some of this movies, and arranged them in a YouTube playlist. If want, you can watch the <a href="">movie explaining what is kinetic typography</a>, or be still and watch the playlist (12 videos, aprox. 22 minutes):</p>
