title: 'Kinetic Typography with your content'
---

<p>Vodafone Portugal recently launched a <a href="http://www.maiorfestadomundo.com/#/videocard/ ">Christmas card</a> which, I believe, must be the first ever kinetic typography video with some user generated content. The card is in portuguese only.</p>

<p>The following video of a Vodafone Christmas card was captured with <a href="http://www.screentoaster.com">ScreenToaster</a>, a online service that allows you to capture your screen. I'm still evaluating it, as this was my first usage of the service, and first conclusion is: it should capture the sound.</p>
