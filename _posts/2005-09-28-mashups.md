title: "Mashups"
---

I heard this term for the first time last week in Boston. I understood "sites that use two or more external sources to provide a new service". The first reference was <a href="http://www.mappr.com/">Mappr</a>, which uses Google Maps and Flickr APIs to geographically organize Flickr photos. But mashups are more than this, they have a huge fun potencial, as stated by this Zdnet's <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/web2explorer/?p=16">post</a>.<br /><br /><b>Update:</b> While thinking on the subject, I decided to make my first movie mashup: five pixar movies and a soundtrack, and you have it, an all new video clip for <a href="http://media.putfile.com/Pixar">Birds of Prey</a> by Fat Boy Slim. While you wait for the download (6MB for a 6m49s clip) you can take a look at the <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/matrix">Web 2.0 Mashup Matrix</a>.
