<p>John Underkoffler was the man who led the team that came up with the interface that Tom Cruise’s character used in the 2002 movie “Minority Report”. After that, he co-founded <a href="http://oblong.com/">Oblong Industries</a>, to make the gesture activated interface a reality.</p><p>Last friday, he demonstrated this gesture technology on TEDs, and said it was already being used in Fortune 50 companies, government agencies and universities, and he predicted that it would soon be available for consumers.</p><p>Here is Oblong's demonstration video:</p><object width="400" height="225"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2229299&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2229299&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="225"></embed></object><p>RSS readers may need to click <a href="//joaobordalo.com">here</a> to see the video.</p>
