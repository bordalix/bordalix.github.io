<p>Fabbers (a.k.a 3D Printers or rapid prototyping machines) are a relatively new form of manufacturing that builds 3D objects by carefully depositing materials drop by drop, layer by layer. While several commercial systems are available, their price range - tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands of dollars - is typically well beyond what an average home user can afford.</p><p>Introducing <a href="http://www.fabathome.org/">Fab@Home</a>: this website provides an open source kit that lets you make your own simple fabber, and use it to print three dimensional objects. You can download and print various items, try out new materials, or upload and share your own projects. Advanced users can modify and improve the fabber itself.</p><p>Here's a YouTube video of a Fab@Home Model 1 building a silicone rubber bottle:</p><p><iframe title="Fab@Home" width="480" height="300" data-src="//www.youtube.com/embed/e26MBnnQEIE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>RSS readers should click <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2007/01/11/fab-home">here</a> to watch the video.</p>
