title: 'Where to surf today'

<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>

<p>Imagine you are in Portugal, you want to go surfing, but you don't know where the best waves are.</p>

<p>What do you do?</p>

<p>
  Well, you open your surf guide, see what surf spots are near enough, search for a beachcam on that spot,
  and after some thorough evaluation, you finally decide where to go. Now it's time to search for the spot
  on Google Maps, and get some directions.
</p>

<p>Wouldn't be great if there was a simpler way of doing all this?</p>

<p><strong>Well, there is.</strong></p>

<p>That's why I made <a href="https://wheretosurftoday.com/">https://wheretosurftoday.com</a> some time ago.</p>

<p><strong>And how exactly it solves the problem?</strong></p>

<p>After you give authorization to the website to access your location, you will get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>133 surf spots covering all the portuguese coast, north to south;                       </li>
  <li>Access to the beachcam link, if one exists;                                             </li>
  <li>Specific information about the spot, useful to every surfer;                            </li>
  <li>Direct links to Google Maps, with the exact coordinates;                                </li>
  <li>Every spot has its own weather and swell forecast, in 3 hours slots;                    </li>
  <li>Surf score taking into consideration the spot specifics and forecast;                   </li>
  <li>Search based on geolocation (show only spots near enough);                              </li>
  <li>Navigate using the built in map;                                                        </li>
  <li>Hassle free, you don't need to sign up whatsoever, no ads;                              </li>
  <li>Easier to type domain, <a href="https://wtst.info">https://wtst.info</a>.               </li>
</ul>

<p>
  There is also an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.id1s3e5v51g2mink1kolsdq">Android app</a> available.
  The big advantage of using the mobile app is that geolocation is a lot more accurate (since it can use the device GPS).
