title: 'Zoetrope - learning with the past'
---

<p>Everyone is capable of accessing a website and read their actual content, right?. But what about past content? How can I see yesterday CNN homepage, or last week "Tipping point" price at Amazon?</p>

<p>And how can one use these <i>past content</i>, correlate it with other sources of <i>past content</i> and generate insights and value? For example, is there (or not) a correlation between bad weather and heavy traffic? Or between weak dollar and stock increases?</p>

<p>It will be easy with <a href="http://www.cond.org/zoetrope.html">Zoetrope</a>, a new tool designed to help track such information by letting users browse backward through time. The tool is still not available to public consumption, but I'm sure it will be the next web revolution.</p>

<p>I'm having a hard time to explain this revolutionary tool by words, so here is the video that explains it better:</p>
