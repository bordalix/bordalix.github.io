---

<p>Yesterday I was zapping through my TV and stopped when I saw a lecture in BBC World about DNA sequencing. The speaker, unknown to me at that time, had a unbelievable message to say: he's about to create the first artificial life form in the planet Earth.</p>

<p>Gene pioneer Dr. J. Craig Venter is one of the principal scientists who decoded the human genome and he was the invited speaker for this year <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dimbleby_Lecture">Richard Dimbleby Lecture</a>. if you have 43 minutes to spare, watch the video and try to answer the following question: what does the future hold in a DNA-driven world?</p>
