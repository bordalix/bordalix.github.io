title: "Fire Meg"
---

<p>Isn't capitalism, democracy and freedom of speech great? A eBay user (and minor stockholder), unhappy with the performance of the company, has issued an <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/firemeg/petition.html">online petition</a> for the removal of Meg Whitman as eBay CEO.</p><p>The 3 main reasons for this petition are:</p><ol><li>the lack of focus: eBay is more concerned in merging technologies (like Skype) than to bet on evolving the online auction sector;<li>eBay and Paypal refuse to address fraud issues and the concerns of the user base;<li>the existence of several technical issues that result in slow and erroneous searches, portions of the site not functioning properly, etc.</ol><p>Is this a good idea? Will it result in anything? I sincerely don't know, but I like it, is a form of active citizenship, and we all should be active citizens. After all, that's why we live in a democracy, right?</p>
