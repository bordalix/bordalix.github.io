title: "The Chinese People's money"
---

<ul>
  <li>People's Bank of China establishes the Renminbi, or people's money, in December 1948. The currency is more commonly called the yuan.</li>
  <li>The yuan is fixed at 2.42 to the dollar from 1953 to 1972 - the height of China's Soviet-style planned economy.</li>
  <li>China introduces a dual track currency system. The yuan is maintained for domestic use only, while foreigners are required to use foreign exchange certificates.</li>
  <li>China adopts current account convertibility in 1996. The yuan trades in a narrow band of 8.28 to the dollar</li>
  <li>July 2005: China announces a shake-up in the way it values its currency. It ditches the dollar peg in favour of a basket of currencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this moment, trades at 8.11, but now it can vary, which is good, I guess...</p>
