title: "Is Bing copying Google?"
---

<p>Yesterday a <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-bing-is-cheating-copying-our-search-results-62914">post in searchengineland.com</a> claimed that Bing was copying Google's results. Microsoft response was "<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-we-do-not-copy-googles-results/8557">We do not copy Google's results"</a>, but Google presented <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/microsofts-bing-uses-google-search.html">overwhelming evidences</a>. So I guess now Microsoft has the burden of proof, and I can't wait to see it.</p>
