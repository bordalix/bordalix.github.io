title: "Apple.com easter egg"
---

<p>Guess what you get if you write "virus" in the <a href="http://apple.com/">Apple</a> website search box... One single result... If you thought Windows, you are right.</p><p><b>Update:</b> Don't click the search button, neither press the Return/Enter key! Just write "virus" (without the commas) and wait.</p>
