title: 'Karl Marx dixit'
---

<p>In Das Kapital Karl Marx writes:"Owners of capital will stimulate the working class to buy more and more of expensive goods, houses and technology, pushing them to take more and more expensive credits, until their debt becomes unbearable. The unpaid debt will lead to bankruptcy of banks, which will have to be nationalized, and the State will have to take the road which will eventually lead to communism."</p>

<p>This was written in 1867. I'm not a communist (on the contrary) but this sentence makes me think.</p>
