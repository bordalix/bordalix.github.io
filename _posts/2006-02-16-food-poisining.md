<p><strong>Update:</strong> If you got here because you need to know more about <i>food poisoning</i>, please bare in mind that probably you misspelled it. You will get better results if  you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=food+poisoning&btnG=Search">search for <i>food pois<strong>o</strong>ning</i> on Google</a>. If you are here to read this article, please continue.</p>

<p>Something we ate tuesday wasn't that good, so we spent the last couple of days trying to get the fluids levels back. Meanwhile, the heart beat returned to normal, so I was able to take some time and make some improvements on this site:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Licensed this webpage under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons License</a>. In summary, you can do whatever you want with work from this site, since you maintain the attribute of the original work. The specific license can be read <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">here</a>;</li>

  <li>Added de <i>de facto</i> icon for RSS sindication. It's more user friendly this way, and brings a little color to the site. Another advantage is to turn more visible the search results - guess orange squares moving are more  eye catching than grey and blue text; </li>

  <li>Since not everyone knows what RSS is, below the sindication icons is now a link pointing to a page explaining <a href="/pages/what-is-rss">what RSS is</a>. The idea was inspired in <a href="http://ivogomes.com">Ivo Gomes blog</a>. Any comments on the text are welcome;</li>

  <li>Added access keys to the site, is now possible to navigate using the keyboard. You can read all about this in the <a href="/pages/colophon">colophon</a> page. Next steps are implement access keys for post commenting and search results, any ideas?</li>

  <li>Updated the <a href="/pages/colophon">colophon</a> page, and added a site history section.</li>
</ul>
