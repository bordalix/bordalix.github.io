title: "Mail storage war, again"
---

Yesterday, I found <a href="http://30gigs.com">30gigs.com</a>, a invite only free 30 GB mail capacity service. And when I was almost bloging about it, the heavy height contender debuted: the first TB (as in Tera Bytes, as in 1024 Giga Bytes) free(!) mail service, <a href="http://mailnation.net">mailnation.net</a>.
