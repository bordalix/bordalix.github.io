title: "Snow trip unpluged"
---

I'm going for one week of snowboarding and tracking at <a href="http://www.avoriaz.com/">Avoriaz</a>, with no laptops attached, so this blog will have a break. It's gonna be freezing, with <a href="http://www.snow-forecast.com/resorts/Avoriaz.0to3mid.shtml">weather forecast</a> pointing maximum temperatures of -6 and minimums of -19 celsius. But who feels cold when you have adrenaline?
