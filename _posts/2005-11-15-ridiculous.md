<p>So, after all the <a href="http://alinobairro.blogspot.com/2005/11/anti-sony-manifesto.html">fuss</a> around this issue, Sony decided to allow people to download an uninstaler for is DRM software. All you have to do is fill a <a href="http://cp.sonybmg.com/xcp/english/form9.html">form</a>, download the software and run it. Know that you know that, don't do it. People from Freedom to Tinker <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=927">found out</a> that if you install Sony uninstaller in your PC, you are opening a huge security hole. Malicious users can execute code in your PC, all you have to do is visit one of there websites. Where (and when) is this going to end?</p>
