Yesterday I spent all night catching up my feeds. Due to personal reasons, I spent the last three days offline, and when I finally get to my <a href="http://bloglines.com/public/bordalix">bloglines account</a> I had thousands of new posts to read. So I decided to do something about it (besides reading them), clean up my blogroll and add some new feeds I'm interested in. As a result, I have now more 6 blogs to read daily (ouch!).<br /><br />Another good decision was to delete Google's AdSense from the blog. This blog exists for more then a year now, and I've earned less than 5 USD from it, so, bye bye AdSense. Essentially, I'm giving free publicity to Google, and they don't need it, right?<br /><br />So, into the juice of those thousands feeds:<br /><ul><li>Talking about Google, if you want to include Google maps on your website, you should take a look at <a href="http://www.system7designs.com/codebase">Phoogle</a>, which allows you to do that with 5 (yes, five!) lines of php.<br /><br /><li>If you're a heavy user of Wikipedia, maybe you can find <a href="http://wiki.lumrix.net/en/">LuMriX</a> useful. It's a Ajax powered Google Suggest look-a-like service for Wikipedia. Can make your Wikipedia searches faster.<br /><br /><li><a href="http://news.com.com/Microsoft+to+standardize+Office+formats/2100-1012_3-5965443.html?part=rss&tag=5965443&subj=news">Microsoft is trying to standardize Office 12 documents</a>, in what they called the Microsoft Open Office XML. It's a good move, but it would be much better if they would follow the Open Document standard. Yes, I'm being naive now...<br /><br /><li><a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=778248&highlight=">Amazon is preparing to launch two new great services</a>, branded Amazon Pages and Amazon Upgrade. In the first one, you will be able to buy pages from a book, instead of buying the entire book, which can be useful in some cases (I don't see much utility in this, but maybe someone will). But the second service is a major breakthrough: when you buy a book from Amazon (70% of my books) you will be able to buy a search service for that specific book!! So, it's the best of the two worlds, I can read my book while getting a tan in the beach, and if I want to find something in it really quickly, I have Amazon Upgrade.<br /><br /><li>And the funny link is about the <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/clip=21846">launching of the new iPod Invisa</a><br /></ul>
