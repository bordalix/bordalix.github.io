title: 'The new iMac keyboard?'
---

<p>Engadget received a few <a href="http://www.engadget.com/gallery/is-this-the-new-imac-keyboard/">photos</a> of what is claimed to be Apple's new keyboard for the iMac computers. I don't know if this is true or not, but I'm sure of one thing: this keyboard is magnificent. I wonder how will it be on the usability stand point.</p>
