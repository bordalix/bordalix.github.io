I've just noticed Google <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Reader</a>, so I decided to give it a try. First step, export my <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/public/bordalix">blogroll</a> from <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>: 20 seconds. Second step, import it to Google Reader. It's not working with Safari, and seems to do nothing with Firefox. Bahhh, it's friday night, I'm going for a beer.
