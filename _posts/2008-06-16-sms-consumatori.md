title: "SMS consumatori"
---

<p>Due to the increase prices in food, the italian government has build and delivered a break-through service, the <a href="http://www.smsconsumatori.it/">SMS consumatori</a>, a service where one can send the name of a product through a SMS and receive the average price for it across Italy. Is this sufficient to stop speculation?</p>
