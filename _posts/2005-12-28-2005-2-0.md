title: "2005 2.0"
---

Everybody is trying to make a list of important things for 2005. Well, I was to, but decided to simply label it the "2.0 year". New business models are building from the peer-to-peer social model found in the net, and from the ability to explore the long tail of the market. In the first, <a href="http://digg.com">digg</a> became bigger then <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> was bought by <a href="http://yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>, and <a href="http://wikipedia.org">wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy">folksonomy</a> became part of our lexical. <br /><br />On the second, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> Music Store proved to be a huge business success, <a href="http://ebay.com">eBay</a> paid several billions to have <a href="http://skype.com">Skype</a>, and everyone is trying to take a piece of the <a href="http://google.com/adsense">AdSense</a> pie. Maybe the best presentation summarizing all this, was made by <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000547.php">Brandon Schauer</a>, check is sources (in the <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/images/publications/essays/What_puts_the_2_in_Web_20.pdf">PDF</a>) for further reading.<br /><br />But this year was also the year of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">Ajax</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/javascript">JavaScript</a> frameworks and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)">mashups</a>. The web is now easier to use, easier to develop, and the API business model is growing rapidly, as stated by the growth of the <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/matrix">mashup matrix</a>. For an excellent example of a mashup, take a look at <a href="http://www.blockrocker.com/">BlockRocker</a> (GoogleMaps + Amazon + Craigslist).<br /><br />Well, 2005 was a good year, hope 2006 be even better to everyone.
