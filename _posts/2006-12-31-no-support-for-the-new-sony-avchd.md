title: 'No support for the new Sony AVCHD'
---

<p>Warning! If you intend to buy a new Sony camcorder, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVCHD">AVCHD</a> capabilities, think twice: there is no support for this codec, neither in Windows or Mac.</p>

<p>My girlfriend's father bought the new Sony HDR-SR1 (with 30GB harddisk) for a journey, recorded more than 300 clips, and now he can't do anything with it! Windows  or Mac are not able to play (or edit) any of those clips, due to the lack of the proper codec.</p>

<p>He requested my help, so I searched for the codec in the web, just to find out that there are a lot of people <a href="http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7594_102-0.html?forumID=59&threadID=211833&messageID=2259548">complaining </a> about the same issue. I drop the search when I found out that <a href="http://www.sonymediasoftware.com/products/product.asp?PID=404&PageID=40">Sony itself does not support it in is own software</a>. The solution? My girlfriend's father will have to wait for the spring. Now, imagine his face when I told him that.</p>

<p>In fact, this should be one of the worst years in Sony's life: look at the <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/tag/sony">evidences</a>. The Sony camcorders with AVCHD support are the new HDR-UX1 and the HDR-SR1. Beware.</p>
