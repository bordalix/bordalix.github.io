title: 'Will "Free" be the next business model?'
---

<p><a href="http://www.trendwatching.com">Trendwatching</a> report for this month, named "Free Love" points out to ongoing rise of "free stuff", and the new business model of offering valuable stuff in exchange of consumer's attention.</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote>FREE LOVE: the ongoing rise of free, valuable stuff that's available to consumers online and offline. From AirAsia tickets to Wikipedia, and from diapers to music.<br /><br />FREE LOVE thrives on an all-out war for consumers' ever-scarcer attention and the resulting new business models and marketing techniques, but also benefits from the ever-decreasing costs of producing physical goods, the post-scarcity dynamics of the online world (and the related avalanche of free content created by attention-hungry members of GENERATION C), the many C2C marketplaces enabling consumers to swap instead of spend, and an emerging recycling culture.<br /><br />Expect FREE LOVE to become an integral if not essential part of doing business.</blockquote>
