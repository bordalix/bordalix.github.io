While reading it, I thought how would be nice to have this information in one, read once, graphical timeline. And since I love to design timelines, I decided to get my hands dirty and create one:</p>

<p>I extended it to 65 moments, based on the honorable mentions by the <a href="http://www.builderau.com.au/program/web/soa/50-significant-moments-from-internet-history/0,339024632,339292301,00.htm">original article</a> and my own opinion.
