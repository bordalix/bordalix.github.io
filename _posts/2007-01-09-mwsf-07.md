title: 'MWSF 07'
---

<p>As everyone, I'm can't wait for today's Steve Jobs keynote at the MacWorld San Francisco. What are the new gadgets he's going to announce? Which software suites will have new versions (or new applications)? Will he announce the delivery date for Leopard (the next version of MacOSX)?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I decided to make a (funny?) exercise: </p>

<ul>
  <li>first, I compile all the rumours someone is talking about and made a list of terms;</li>
  <li>next, for each term, went to Google and search for 'MWSF 07' + term;</li>
  <li>finally, created the following graphic with the number of results:<br/><br/><a href="https://cdn.joaobordalo.com/images/static/blog/mwsf07.png"><img src="https://cdn.joaobordalo.com/images/static/blog/mwsf07.png" width="360" height="243"></a></li>
</ul>

<p>The keynote will start at 5 pm GMT, so soon we will be able to know if this is (or not) a viable method for predict Apple announcements</p>
