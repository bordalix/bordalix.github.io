title: 'I love my Mac. I just wish it came in green'
---

<p>A great <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/apple/">site</a> by Greenpeace, aiming the reducing of usage of hazardous substances in Apple equipment. They mimicked the Apple website, changed the colors to green, and added a strong environmental concern. The website also includes <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/apple/ads">the Greenpeace version of an Apple ad</a>. Brilliant.</p>
