Having nothing more to say, here are some news worth notice:<br /><ul><li>In the video world, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/calc/news/index.shtml">BBC is opening is archive</a> to UK public, and now you are able to download nearly 80 news reports (from the fall of the Berlin Wall to Tiananmen Square) and create something unique. Another great idea from BBC, like <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk">backstage</a>;</li><br /><li>Still on the video world, it seems that Microsoft is helping Entertainment Group to deliver <a href="http://www.vongo.com">Vongo</a>, a new movie download service that allows consumers to view full-length studio films, concerts and TV shows. The site is open only to Windows users and US customers, so you have to use a US open proxy to be able to access it (<strong>tip:</strong> I used this free proxy, 208.21.64.4 port 80);</li><br /><li>From ArsTechnica, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060103-5886.html">GNU liberates VoIP with a new open source telephony stack</a>. In my humble opinion, this could be the push needed for total interconnection between different VoIP providers: this could be the <i>lingua franca</i> for VoIP.</li><br /><li>A beautiful piece of technology, <a href="http://labs.systemone.at/retrievr/">Retrievr</a>, allows you to search for photos in Flickr by making a sketch of what you want. Really nice and well done;</li><br /><li>As everyone else, I'm waiting for <a href="http://www.allpeers.com/">AllPeers</a>, a new Firefox plugin. This could lead to a all new P2P ball game. For now, you can take a peek to some <a  href="http://www.allpeers.com/blog/2005/12/22/allpeers-screenshots/">screenshots here</a>;</li><br /><li>And finally, transform your iPod\*, iPod mini or iPod nano into a full-fledged video recorder/player with the new <a href="http://w3.isee-ato.com/">iSee 360i</a>. You have to see it to believe it.</li><br /></ul>
