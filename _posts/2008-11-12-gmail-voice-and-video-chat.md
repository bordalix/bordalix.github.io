title: "Gmail voice and video chat"
---

<p>Google announced today the voice and video chat for Gmail. To make this work, users have to install a <a href="http://mail.google.com/videochat">small browser plugin</a>. Google will start enabling these new features for all Gmail and Google Apps today, and as is typical for new releases in Gmail, Google will roll this feature out to all users over the "next day or so". Is this the final nail on Skype's coffin?</p><iframe title="Gmail voice and video chat" width="480" height="300" data-src="//www.youtube.com/embed/JFGJRfoK9xQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>RSS readers should click <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2008/11/12/gmail-voice-and-video-chat">here</a> to watch the video.</p>
