<p>After reading the BBC article about the plans for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6305957.stm">YouTube to share is ad revenue with users</a>, I recall a recent article I've read in <a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/">Trend Watching</a> about <a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/trends/gen-cash.htm">Generation Cash</a>.</p><p>About three and a half years ago, they talked about a new trend arising, what they called <a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/trends/CUSTOMER-MADE.htm">Generation C</a>(ontent). I think we now can all agree that they were right, and that it culminated with the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html?aid=434&from=o&to=http%3A//www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1569514%2C00.html">Time's Person of Year: You</a> issue.</p> Meanwhile, companies are earning a lot of money by aggregating one's content, so it's only fair to share part of the profit with the producers of the content.</p><blockquote>GENERATION C(ONTENT) is joining GENERATION C(ASH). If consumers produce the content, if they are the content, and that content brings in money for aggregating brands, then revenue and profit-sharing is going to be one of 2007’s main themes in the online space. It’s not like brands will have a choice: talented consumers are going to be too sought after to remain satisfied with thank you notes. Get ready for an avalanche of revenue sharing deals, reward schemes and sumptuous gifts aimed at luring creative consumers.</blockquote><p>YouTube rivals are already following the trend, and YouTube must stay a competetive player, so it was just a matter of time. Here is an image of the Generation C(ash) pioneers:</p><a href="https://cdn.joaobordalo.com/images/static/blog/gencash.png"><img width=400 height=300 src="https://cdn.joaobordalo.com/images/static/blog/gencash.png"></a><p>By the way, shouldn't we be talking about <a href="http://fon.com">Fon</a> also?
