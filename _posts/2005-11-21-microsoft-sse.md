Microsoft announced SSE (Simple Sharing Extensions), which can be seen as a two way item sharing (think bidirectional RSS). The extensions described in the Simple Sharing Extensions enable feed readers and publishers to generate and process incoming item changes in a manner that enables consistency to be achieved. For example, two or more will be able to co-edit a post, which can be a huge revolution in the blogsphere. If you are a technical person, you should take a look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/rss/sse/">specification page</a>, after all, Microsoft launched it under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> Share Alike license. Are the winds of change blowing from Richmond?
