---

original article <a href="http://www.shareholder.com/paypal/releaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=171765&Category=US">here</a>, bold it's my contribution to it:<br /><br />PayPal, the global online payment service <b>(is Visa and Google sleeping on the job?)</b>, today announced new micropayments processing fees for digital goods. The new pricing will provide merchants <b>(read porn site owners)</b> with a more affordable way to process payments for low-cost digital content such as video games <b>(read porn films)</b>, online greeting cards, news articles, mobile phone content and digital music. PayPal's micropayments pricing is designed to give customers the convenience of a-la-carte purchases <b>(read porn a-la-carte)</b>, such as 99-cent downloadable ringtones <b>(read porn movies)</b>, without having to sign up for annual subscriptions <b>(no one needs to know you love porn)</b> or pre-funded payment accounts <b>(porn when you want, no need to pre-pay it)</b>.
