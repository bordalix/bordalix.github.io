<p>Original article <a href="http://www.shareholder.com/paypal/releaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=171765&Category=US">here</a>, bold it's my contribution to it:</p>

<p>PayPal, the global online payment service <strong>(is Visa and Google sleeping on the job?)</strong>, today announced new micropayments processing fees for digital goods. The new pricing will provide merchants <strong>(read porn site owners)</strong> with a more affordable way to process payments for low-cost digital content such as video games <strong>(read porn films)</strong>, online greeting cards, news articles, mobile phone content and digital music. PayPal's micropayments pricing is designed to give customers the convenience of a-la-carte purchases <strong>(read porn a-la-carte)</strong>, such as 99-cent downloadable ringtones <strong>(read porn movies)</strong>, without having to sign up for annual subscriptions <strong>(no one needs to know you love porn)</strong> or pre-funded payment accounts <strong>(porn when you want, no need to pre-pay it)</strong>.</p>
