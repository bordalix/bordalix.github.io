title: "Sony responds to project Natal"
---

<p>Who said <a href="http://e3expo.com/">E3</a> was dead? After Microsoft's <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2009/06/02/project-natal-for-xbox-360">project Natal</a>, Sony responds with his new motion controller for Playstation Eye:</p><iframe title="Sony responds to project Natal" width="480" height="300" data-src="//www.youtube.com/embed/bgLN7uOj8Jg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><br />Millimetric precision, almost instant response, and above all, a live demo with the technology, not an environment controlled, video manipulated demo like Microsoft did. So, Santa, wait up for my Christmas request, will you?</p>
