title: 'Blackberry Playbook'
---

<p>Here it is, RIM's response to the iPad, the Blackberry Playbook. Main differences I can tell from this video are the true multitasking interface, and flash support (or how they call it, "uncompromised browsing").</p>

<p>Note, it will be only available in "early 2011", so it will compete not with the present iPad, but most probably with the 2nd generation iPad. Prices are still not available.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> a nice <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/28/blackberry-playbook-vs-ipad-vs-galaxy-tab-vs-streak-the-tale/">comparison</a> between the new Blackberry's Playbook, Apple's iPad, Samsung's Galaxy Tab and Dell's Streak.</p>
