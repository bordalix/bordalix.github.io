title: 'Data stored in your browser'
---

<p>Back in the late 90's, I had this really crazy ideia of having data stored in the browsers of our web site viewers. We run against a lot of technical problems, so we had to cancel the whole deal. But today I found someone with the same levels of insanity (thank god i'm not alone) and definitely, a best programmer: combining <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/projects/storage/README.html">AMASS</a> with the <a href="http://trimpath.com/project/wiki/TrimQuery">TrimQuery</a> SQL engine, he is able to <a href="http://www.sysbotz.com/articles/jsdb/index.htm">store full SQL</a> tables in your browser cache. Could this be the driver for new AJAX applications?</p>
