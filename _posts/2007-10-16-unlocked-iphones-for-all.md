title: 'Unlocked iPhones for all'
---

<p>Via the <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/16/business/apple.php">International Herald Tribune</a>, Apple choose Orange to be the exclusive seller of iPhones in France. So, what's new?</p>

<p>Due to French law prohibiting the forced bundling of mobile devices with a specific carrier, Apple and Orange will be required to sell an unlocked version of the iPhone.</p>

<p>So, my iPhone will be available in France starting next November, starting at &euro;399, plus Orange contract and flight price. Can't wait.</p>
