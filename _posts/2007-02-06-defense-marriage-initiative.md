title: 'Defense Marriage Initiative'
---

<p>In Portugal, people is discussing next Sunday's referendum (should or should not be a crime for a woman to abort in the first 10 weeks of gestation).</p>

<p>In Washington, people are discussing if one can marry with another even if they have no plans to procreate. Better, if the law is approved, every one who get married in the state of Washington, have three years to procreate, or get their marriage "unrecognized". In my humble opinion, <a href="http://www.wa-doma.org/">The Defense Marriage Initiative</a> must be the stupidest law I ever saw. (via <a href="http://simplicidade.org/">Melo</a>)</p>
