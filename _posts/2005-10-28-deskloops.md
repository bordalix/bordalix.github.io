title: 'Deskloops'

<p>My iMac is having video problems: my screen is scrambled. After some goggling, I found out that my iMac serial number is in the range for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/imac/repairextensionprogram/">Apple repair extension program</a>, so it has to be repaired. Meanwhile, back to Windows. But I surelly lack Exposé, and meanwhile, I found <a href="http://www.xilokit.com/deskloops/deskloops.html">Deskloops</a>, and my first impression is that, maybe, there are some ideas that can be taken to the next Exposé version. Apple dudes should take a look at this.</p>
