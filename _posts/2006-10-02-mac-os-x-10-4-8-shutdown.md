title: "Mac OS X 10.4.8 = Shutdown"
---

<p>For those out there who had upgraded to the 10.4.8 Mac OS X version (available since last thursday, if I'm not mistaken) and have their computers shuting down without reason, the solution is very simple: boot the Mac in safe mode (press the Shift key while booting), wait for the Mac to boot (which can take a while, don't worry) and then restart it in normal mode. It worked for me.</p>
