---

<p>Via <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2000/07/20/speedlight000720.html">cbc.ca</a>, scientists were able to cause a light pulse to travel hundreds of times faster than normal:</p>

<blockquote>It raced so fast the pulse exited a specially-prepared chamber before it even finished entering it.
</blockquote>

<p>So, it looks like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoÃ£o_Magueijo">Jo&atilde;o Magueijo</a> and is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_speed_of_light">Variable Speed of Light theory</a> was right all along.</p>
