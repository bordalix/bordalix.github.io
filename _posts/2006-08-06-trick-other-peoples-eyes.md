<p>Two funny visual tricks to resolve common problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everyone who owns a wireless network has the problem of parasite surfers, those guys who grab your open network and use it for accessing the Internet. The common solution for this problem is to use some kind of cryptography (WEP, WPA, etc), but now you can do something different: with <a href="http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pete/upside-down-ternet.html">Upside-Down-Ternet</a> you can still offer network access to the people, but the images they will see in the Internet will be upside-down, or even blured. Well, this will not resolve the problem of people using your network to download bittorrents or other type of "non visual" data, but it sure is a funny thing to do;</li>
  <li>Another common problem to people is how to surf the Internet in the office, without raising many eyebrows. So what if you could surf the Internet, but inside a Word document? Just like if you were editing an important paper to your company. Your office collegues will start to see you as the most productive, never surfing, always working guy, right? Just use <a href="http://www.workfriendly.net/">workFRIENDLY</a> to do it.</li>
</ul>
