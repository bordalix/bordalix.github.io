<p><a href="http://www.tabbloid.com/">Tabbloid</a> is a project from Hewlett-Packard that turns your  feeds into a pdf document (someone call it a magazine). All you need to do is point it at one or more feeds, set up a delivery time and you will get a nicely formatted pdf file by email. You can also generate a pdf on the fly from one or more feeds.</p>

<p>As a joke, I try it with the <a href="http://www.prt.sc/">PrintScreen</a> feed. You can see a screenshot here or download the resulting  <a href="https://joaobordalo.com/images/static/blog/prtsc.pdf">pdf file</a>.</p>
