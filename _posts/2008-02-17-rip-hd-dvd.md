title: 'RIP HD-DVD'
---

<p>If what Reuters is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSL1627196120080216 ">reporting</a> is true (still waiting for confirmation), Toshiba has thrown the towel on the HD-DVD vs Blu-Ray war. I guess last Friday's Wal-Mart decision to abandon the format and stick to Blu-Ray, was HD-DVD's last nail in the coffin.</p>

<p>Better this way, this war was only stalling the development of the next generation DVDs, and creating a lot of confusion on customers head.</p>
