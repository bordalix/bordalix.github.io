title: 'Google del.icio.us'
---

<p>Finally, Google responded to Yahoo's acquisition of <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> by developing his own service, named <a href="http://www.google.com/s2/sharing/stuff">Google Shared Stuff</a>. The service looks crappy, but I think that's because the lack of users in the system. Being a kind of service heavily dependent on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>, it will take a while for the service to bloom and flourish. I'm willing to try it, since del.icio.us is getting slower and slower search results.</p>
