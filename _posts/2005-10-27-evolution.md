title: 'Evolution'

<p>The world is evolving, and so are human relations. Media formats will be purely digital, and distribution will be in a peer-to-peer model. Search engines will understand what I want, in plain english. But should I say 'will' or 'are'? Is the future nearer then we think?</p>

<ul>
  <li>NTT is experimenting with <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/10/25/human.remote.control.ap/index.html">human remote controlling</a>. The idea is "to perhaps make video games more realistic", which can be very exciting, but having low voltage currents through my brain isn't my preferred definition of fun.</li>
  <li><a href="http://videoegg.com">Videoegg</a> claim is "internet video publishing as simple as it ought to be like posting a photo or frying an egg". Well, I don't know, don't have the time to try it, but it seems people from <a href="http://sixapart.com"/>Six Apart</a> really like this service: the partner each other, and now you can now post video in your typepad blog, as simple as frying an egg.</li>
  <li>How will be TV in 10 years? Well, I don't know, but <a href="http://brightcove.com/">BrightCove</a> as a really strong idea, and it makes sense. Just add mass adoption of broadband, dropping costs in video production, new reach media formats and home networks, and you have a all new economy model.</li>
  <li>From the <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/web2explorer/?p=40&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=zdblog">web2explorer</a> blog, I found this "more-than-a-search-engine" technology, ePrecis. Read the post, and then try and throw some sentences to the <a href="http://eprecis.com/">text box</a></li>
</ul>
