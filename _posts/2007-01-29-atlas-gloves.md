<p><a href="http://atlasgloves.org/about">Atlas Gloves</a> is a DIY (Do It Yourself) physical interface for controlling 3D mapping applications like <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a>. With a pair of illuminating gloves, the user is  able to fly above the world and zoom in and out, tilt, and rotate by doing various gestures. The technical implementation includes a small camera attached to a computer.</p>
