<p><b>Update 19-7-2007:</b> <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUKN1921962520070919?rpc=44">Reuters confirms the rumour</a>.</p> <p>If <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSL0432369320070904">this</a> is true, Apple stock will go ballistic. Steve Jobs talked about selling 800.000 iPhones this year, and forecasted 10 million in 2008 (1% of market share). If what <a href="http://www.isuppli.com/">iSuppli</a> states is true, the iPhone outsold all smartphones in the United States in July, its first full month on sale, accounting for 1.8 percent of all U.S. mobile handset sales. iSuppli forecast for iPhone sales this year is now 4.5 million.</p><p>Can't wait for the European (read 3G) version.</p>
