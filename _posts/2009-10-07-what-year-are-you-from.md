<p> PhotoSketch is an “Internet Image Montage” project from five students at Tsinghua University and the National University of Singapore. The basic premise, which they present in the form of a research paper [pdf], works like this:</p><ul>  <li>Draw the outlines of the figures you want in your picture – anything from seagulls to a wedding kiss;</li>  <li>Add labels for each of the items, as well as for the background.</li>  <li>PhotoSketch will then find real-life images to match your doodles and put them together in a Photoshopped image that will make your jaw drop.</li></ul><object width="400" height="300"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=6496886&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=6496886&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="300"></embed></object><p>And before you say "it must be fake", download and read the <a href="http://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/eletp/Papers/sigasia09_photosketch.pdf">research paper</a> (in pdf), already evaluated by the scientific community.</p>
