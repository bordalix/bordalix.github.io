title: 'A tale about security'
---

<p>Once open <a href="http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9900456-7.html">a time</a>, a <a href="http://apple.com">company</a> which had a lot of people using his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itunes">digital media player</a>, pushed people to use his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_%28web_browser%29">browser</a> through an 'almost automatic' software update. People <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/operating_systems/apples_windows_invasion.html">complained</a> about this behaviour, others <a href="http://blech.vox.com/library/post/windows-invasion-translation.html">defend it</a>, and there was what someone called a <i>nano-scandal</i>, and a lot of people installed the new browser.</p>

<p>And then there were the bad guys (cause a tale has always bad guys), who found <a href="http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/blog/2008/03/27/day-two-of-cansecwest-pwn-to-own---we-have-our-first-official-winner-with-picture">a way to break</a> into someone's computer through a bug in the referenced browser. So, the company was/his installing a lock into a lot of personal computers, and someone has just found the master key.</p>

<p>Bad timing? Bad luck? Or karma?</p>
