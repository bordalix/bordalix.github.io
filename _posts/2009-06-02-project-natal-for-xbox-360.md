title: 'Project Natal for XBOX 360'
---

<p>While the buzz from Microsoft these days concentrate on <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a>, their new "not a search engine but a decision engine" service, I think the real breakthrough technology people should be looking and talking about is the new project named <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/projectnatal/">Natal</a> for XBOX 360.</p><p>It's a all new ball game in the human computer interaction, where one does not need a controller to play and interact with the XBOX 360. Just be there and play. Watch the demo:</p><iframe title="Project Natal for XBOX 360" width="480" height="300" data-src="//www.youtube.com/embed/oACt9R9z37U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><br />Natal is the portuguese word for Christmas, does it means it will be available in Christmas? If so, Santa, I know is a bit early to ask for presents, but unless otherwise, this is what I want.</p><p><strong>Update 4 hours later:</strong> <a href="http://procrastineering.blogspot.com/2009/06/project-natal.html">Johnny Chung Lee</a> has some technical insights of this project in his blog.</p>
