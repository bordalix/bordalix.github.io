<p>Every now and then people ask me for iOS versions of my mobile apps.</p>

<p>I don't build them, due to the following text in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/terms/apple_developer_agreement.pdf">Apple Developer Agreement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
11. Apple Independent Development. Nothing in this Agreement will impair Appleâ€™s right to
develop, acquire, license, market, promote or distribute products, software or technologies that
perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, any other products, software
or technologies that you may develop, produce, market, or distribute. In the absence of a separate
written agreement to the contrary, Apple will be free to use any information, suggestions or
recommendations you provide to Apple pursuant to this Agreement for any purpose, subject to any
applicable patents or copyrights.
</blockquote>

<p>In a nutshell, if you agree with the terms (and you have to if you want to publish something in the App Store), you are granting Apple a <strong>license to steal</strong> your idea/app.</p>

<p>Am I being paranoid? It already happened with <a href="https://thehustle.co/apple-developers-steal">Breathe and F.lux</a>.</p>

<p>Android terms doesn't have this, so here you have it, this is why I don't publish my apps on the App Store.</p>
