<p>Following the path from <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2007/05/17/earth-guide">Earth Guide</a>, Nikon has decided to build a website that help us to put the all universe in perspective. It's hard to explain the concept, so here it is the explanation from the website itself:</p>

<blockquote>We are able to view all entities, from the microworld to the universe, from a single perspective. By setting them up against a scale, we are able to compare and understand things which cannot be physically compared</blockquote>

<p>It's an amazing experience, so try it out <a href="http://www.nikon.co.jp/main/eng/feelnikon/discovery/universcale/index_f.htm">here</a> and enjoy.
