title: 'Apple rumors and fakes'
---

<p>Yesterday I got my first iPod, the black nano. And you know the drill: it's your new gadget, and it's the best of the world. But today, while reading my daily blogroll, I founded two pieces that got me thinking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AppleInsider shows <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1862">a new Apple fillings for the iPod redesign</a>. It seems Apple intends to abandon the Click-Whell interface, so my brand new iPod nano will soon be a museum piece.</li>
  <li>A <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=9teB3cgZGcw">video</a> showing what the author called the OSX Leopard Mobile running on a video iPod, with stylus and sensitive screen. My first reaction was to curse for choosing the iPod nano, but than I realized the video is fake: it's a video simulating the user interface, and you can notice that by watching it very carefully. Watch the video below.</li>
  <li>Last, ThinkSecret says <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0607charts.html">Apple will deliver a spreadsheet software</a> (Charts? Numbers?) in iWorks'07, scheduled to launch on January 2007.</li>
</ul>
