title: "Watching TV"
---

<p>I have just found <a href="">TVTUGA.com</a>, a website where you can watch more than 150 TV channels, including the portuguese ones. Since I'm learning to play poker (with some friends), I can now watch the Poker channel at work (hope the boss don't read this). Well, was that or the Playboy channel...</p><p>The quality is not great, and I'm sure that in some days it will be impossible to watch any channel, just because I think the people from TVTUGA don't have the necessary bandwidth to accomodate a lot of users. Hope I'm wrong, good luck TVTUGA.</p>
