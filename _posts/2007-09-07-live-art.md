<p><strong>Update:</strong> Another <a href="http://joaogomes.com/">friend</a> sent me another great video, which I placed in the bottom of this article. And you? Do you have any good video to share?</p><p>A <a href="http://www.palcoprincipal.com/user/guitargirl">friend</a> sent me a YouTube video of a paint artist making a painting in a live audience, synchronized with the music. It's a great video, and you should watch it to the end:</p><iframe title="Live art" width="480" height="300" data-src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OIJtKxdRQzY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>RSS readers should click <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2007/09/07/live-art">here</a> to watch the movies.</p>
