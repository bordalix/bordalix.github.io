title: 'Fun materials'
---

<p>To keep us amused during the holidays, Tom from the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/blog/technology/">New Scientist Technology Blog</a> has compiled a short list of fun materials - stuff that behaves a little bit outside the norm - with instructions to do it at home.</p>

<p>Here goes a short version of <a  href="http://www.newscientist.com/blog/technology/2006/12/stuff-of-dreams.html">the original article</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dilatants, also knows as Non-Newtonian fluids, so named because it's properties cannot be described in terms of the concepts of classical fluids. For instance, they get more solid when stressed;</li>
  <li>Auxetic material - materials that get thicker when stretched. Pull them in one direction and they expand in another;</li>
  <li>Superfluids - liquids that flow without friction. They can effortlessly flow through the tiniest of cracks and will even flow up the walls of a beaker and out the top;</li>
  <li>Ferrofluids - magnetic fluids that can look spectacular. They're made from nanoscale magnetic particles suspended in a liquid;</li>
  <li>Dry ice. Carbon dioxide freezes at -78.5 Â°C and it's fun and versatile stuff:</li>
</ul>
