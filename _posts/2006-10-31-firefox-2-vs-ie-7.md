title: "Firefox 2 vs IE 7"
---

<p>The initial round was won by Firefox 2, with 2 million downloads in the first 24 hours. IE 7 got 3 million downloads in 4 days, which gives something like 750 thousands downloads per day.</p><p>But now will enter Windows Automatic Update, which will boost IE 7 downloads number. But what matters for me is that user preferences are bending for the free, open-source browser, Firefox.</p>
