title: "Nuno Markl"
---

I was exploring this <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/delicious/subscribe-to-free-delicious-video-in-itunes-130752.php">post</a> from <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/">lifehacker</a> titled "Subscribe to free, del.icio.us videos in iTunes", and, while on that, decided to go to the podcast directory from iTunes. For my surprise (and pride), "Ha vida em Markl" was in the top of the list, which is amazing for a portuguese podcast, even if it is from <a href="http://www.nunomarkl.tv/">Nuno Markl</a>. Thumbs up Nuno.
