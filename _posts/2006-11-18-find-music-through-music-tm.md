<blockquote>This is easily the coolest technology I&#8217;ve seen in years: Go to the Creative Commons <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org">search page</a>. Click on the <a href="http://www.owlmm.com/">OWL Music Search</a> tab. (Depending upon the browser, you might need to run a fake search to get it to come alive &#8212; we&#8217;re working on this, but just type anything in the search bar). You&#8217;ll then see OWL&#8217;s Music Search interface. Drop an MP3 on OWL. It will analyze it and show you <strong>similar sounding</strong> Creative Commons licensed music. You select the part of the song you want to match; it finds the closest match it can find.</blockquote>
