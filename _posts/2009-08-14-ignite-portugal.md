<p>My friend <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/miguel-muñoz-duarte/0/a6b/184">Miguel Muñoz Duarte</a> and his company, iMatch, will bring Ignite to Portugal. But what is Ignite? Ignite captures the best of geek culture in a series of five-minute speed presentations on topics ranging from The Best Way to Buy a Car to Hacking Chocolate. Each speaker gets only 5 minutes, with 20 slides that auto-forwards every 15 seconds. The motto is "Enlighten us, but make it quick".</p> <p>If you are interested, you can be the next speaker. Visit the <a href="http://www.igniteportugal.blogspot.com/">Ignite Portugal website</a> and follow the instructions. Still with doubts? Maybe the next Ignite presentation will convince you:</p><iframe title="Ignite Portugal" width="480" height="300" data-src="//www.youtube.com/embed/rRa1IPkBFbg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>RSS readers should click <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2009/08/14/ignite-portugal">here</a> to see the video.</p>
