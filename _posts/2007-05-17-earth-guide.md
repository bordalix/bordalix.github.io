<p>From the Japanese Science and Technology Agency, check <a href="http://jvsc.jst.go.jp/earth/guide/english/data/top.html">Earth Guide</a>, one of the best sites I have seen concerning the Earth, the Sun, the Solar system and even the Milky Way galaxy.</p>

<p>The graphics are astonishing, the data very well put on perspective, and all the navigation and looks of the site are extremely well accomplished. Again, great great site!</p>
