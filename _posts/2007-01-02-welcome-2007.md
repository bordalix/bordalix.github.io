<p>The year has started with a blast: <a href="http://publico.clix.pt/">Publico</a>'s <a href="http://www.ciberjornalismo.com/pontomedia/">Ponto Media blog</a> as pointed to my <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2006/12/28/5-games-to-think-about">5 games to think about</a> post, so currently the number of unique visitors and page views is twice the average.</p>

<p>It's never too late to make new year resolutions, and the games itself help us to think about the world we are living. Political issues, ecological concerns and religious radicalism are every day issues, and we <strike>can</strike>/<strike>should</strike>/must have an active roll. No more "someone has to do something about it". It's up to you now.</p>

<p>So, <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2006/12/28/5-games-to-think-about">play the games</a>, spread the word, and think about it.</p>
