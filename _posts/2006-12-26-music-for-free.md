<p>Totally legal, more than 190.000 licensed Creative Commons tracks.</p><p><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/">Jamendo</a> allows artists to promote and publish their music. Artists have the opportunity to show their creativity, and the public has a place to listen to, download, and share new music.</p><p>If you find an album that you like, you can share it on your blog, write a review, or donate directly to the artist. Some artists will even include the list of people who donated in the booklet of their forthcoming albums. A great site for both artists and fans. Everybody wins, except for the big record labels of course.</p>
