title: 'iPhone unlock in 3 minutes'
---

<p>Finally, on the 8th of February, <a href="http://iphonejtag.blogspot.com/">George Hotz</a> (please donate) cracked the protection scheme used in the iPhone. In a matter of hours, a lot if scripts and applications arose in order to facilitate the job to the average joe. </p>

<p>Yesterday, a new tool hit the radar, and is now possible to unlock, jailbreak and activate iPhones 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 OTB in less than 3 minutes. So, if you are one in the million that have a locked iPhone, grab the <a href="http://home.no/geezuzz/ZiPhoneGUI.exe">ZiPhoneGUI</a> tool (available only for windows) and happy cracking.</p>
