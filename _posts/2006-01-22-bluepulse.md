Guys, if you own a cell phone (who doesn't), you have to point your browser to the <a href="http://bluepulse.com/">bluepulse website</a>, sign-up, and follow the instructions. These guys developed one amazing software, described as:<br /><blockquote><br />A free program for mobile phones that allows you to run tiny, useful widgets for a variety of uses, such as instant messaging and RSS.<br /></blockquote><br />And it's true, and works like a charm: in less than 5 minutes, I was talking with my buddies in MSN. I'm going to try now the RSS reader.<br /><br />The platform allows any one to develop new widgets, and I surely hope the business model motivates people to develop new functionalities and services. I'm really impressed with this, and I reiterate: go to the <a href="http://bluepulse.com/">website</a> and try it.
