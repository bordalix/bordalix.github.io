<p>Please help me to love myself. <br >Don’t spoil me; I know quite well that I shouldn’t have all that I ask for.<br >I’m only testing you – give me the discipline I need.<br >I need my sense of dignity so don’t belittle me in front of people.<br >I’ll take more notice if you talk to me with as much respect as you give your grown-up friends.<br >Don’t be too upset when I say that I hate you. It isn’t you I hate but your power over me.<br >Please be patient with me, I may be a late bloomer.<br >Please keep me feeling good about myself by telling the good things about myself more often than you tell me of the bad things you don’t like.<br >Don’t bribe me or make rash promises. Remember that I feel badly let down when promises are broken.<br >The more you give me the safety to expose my true feelings the more of my inner beauty I will risk showing.<br >Don’t be inconsistent, that confuses me and makes me lose faith in you.<br >Please praise and acknowledge me for who I am and not for the things I do, for then I will grow up without the stress of comparing and competing.<br >Please keep reminding me that I am good, capable and worthwhile, so that I grow up loving and accepting myself.<br >And finally, don’t forget that I can’t thrive without your love and understanding… but I don’t need to tell you, do I?</p>
