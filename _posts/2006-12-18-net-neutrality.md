<p>This is not my <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2005/11/02/network-neutrality">first post</a> about Network Neutrality, neither <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2005/11/09/network-neutrality-ii">the second</a>, but since I crossed with this couple of videos in YouTube, I decided to take another try, and share them with you.</p><p>The first video is from one against Net Neutrality:<br/><iframe title="Net neutrality" width="480" height="300" data-src="//www.youtube.com/embed/oPIYxtjLFeI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Which do you prefer?</p>
