  <li>Lawrence Lessig wrote an interesting post about <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003290.shtml">the need for regulation</a> on the "net neutrality" issue. If you want to know more on this subject, try the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality">Wikipedia definition</a>.</li>
