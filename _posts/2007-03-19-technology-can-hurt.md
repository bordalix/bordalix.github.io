title: "Technology can hurt"
---

<p>Last week I spend it snowboarding in the French Alps with some friends. This year, for the first time, we had like 2 small video cameras, so people were always trying to film that "Roast beef grab", the "Backside 180" or  the "Indy grab".</p><p>Whenever the camera was on, my friends were taking huge risks, doing big jumps and strange techniques, in order to stay "good in the picture".</p><p>The result? Three man down: one shoulder, one ankle and a visit to a french hospital to do some x-rays due to a heavy chest pain. Fortunately, I don't give a damn for great snow movies, so all I've got was tired muscles and a rested brain.</p><p>The conclusion? Technology can hurt you, beware.</p>
