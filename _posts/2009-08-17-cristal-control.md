It's a interactive table, much like Microsoft's Surface, with a huge difference: a camera placed on the top of the living room creates an image which is the interface itself. Confused? Watch the demo and wait for Christmas:</p><iframe title="Cristal Control" width="480" height="300" data-src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Tio5OvIqToc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>RSS readers should click <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2009/08/17/cristal-control">here</a> to watch the video.</p>
