<p>CRISTAL (<strong>C</strong>ontrol of <strong>R</strong>emotely <strong>I</strong>nterfaced <strong>S</strong>ystems using <strong>T</strong>ouch-based <strong>A</strong>ctions in <strong>L</strong>iving spaces) is a ubber simple user interface for controlling multimedia devices and home automation systems. It's a interactive table, much like Microsoft's Surface, with a huge difference: a camera placed on the top of the living room creates an image which is the interface itself. Confused? Watch the demo and wait for Christmas:</p><iframe title="Cristal Control" width="480" height="300" data-src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Tio5OvIqToc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>RSS readers should click <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2009/08/17/cristal-control">here</a> to watch the video.</p>
