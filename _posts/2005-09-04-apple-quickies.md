<p>So, yesterday Apple announced:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the iTunes <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/mobile/">phone</a>, nothing new, since SonyEricsson did it <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=global&lc=en&amp;amp;amp;ver=4001&template=pc3_1_1&amp;zone=pc&lm=pc3_1&amp;prid=2973">previously</a>. And the fact of beeing iTunes vs Other Music Store maybe not an advantage after all, since operators are denying to buy the iTunes Phone: they want a peace of the cake in the music market. Let's wait and see what the future reserves to us;</li>
  <li>iTunes 5, with some really neat <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">new features</a>. Still have to install and try it;</li>
  <li>iPod nano, with one of the best claims ever: <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">impossibly small</a>.</li>
</ul>
