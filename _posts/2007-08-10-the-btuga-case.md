title: "The BTuga case"
---

<p>Two weeks ago, ASAE (Economics and Food Security Agency) seized the servers of three portuguese torrent aggregators, BTuga, ZeTuga and ZeMula. The <a href="http://ultimahora.publico.clix.pt/noticia.aspx?id=1301001">news</a> also informed that ASAE was planning to investigate all the users of this sites. Yes, we are talking about more than 200 thousand users. If the task seems impossible to achieve, due to the huge number of users, it also seems illegal under the EU law, as stated by this <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/03/europe_music-downloads_identification/">article from The Register</a> (concerning a different case).</p><p>What do you think about it?</p>
