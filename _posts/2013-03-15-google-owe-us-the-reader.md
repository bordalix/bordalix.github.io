title: "Google owe us the Reader"
---

<p>Like everyone knows by now, <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.pt/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">Google announced it will retire Google Reader on July 1st</a>. For me, this are very bad news, since I strongly rely on Reader to get access and organize my feed of information.</p><p>I've been working with the Internet since before the invention of the World Wide Web, and, call me old school, I still heavily believe in RSS feeds to get information, since I don't believe in social media and services like <a href="http://flipboard.com">Flipboard</a> to get fresh, relevant information about all the different topics I'm interested in (which goes from systems scalability to biology, or from economics to user experience design).</p><p>From my 302 subscriptions, <a href="https://www.google.com/reader/view/#trends-page">Google Reader states</a> that I've read 9.789 items over the last 30 days, so I consider myself as a heavy user. But the usage is not confined to the interface, since I also depend on the Reader's API. <a href="http://reederapp.com">Reeder</a> in my iOS devices, Android reader, <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> recipes and podcasts, all of them depend on the existence of the Reader's API.</p><p>Additionally, I think <b>Google owe us Google Reader</b>. Google is subsidizing Google Reader from day one, which killed all competition. I started by using <a href="http://bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>, and later had to change to Google Reader, since it was becoming the de facto standard for RSS reading. Retiring Google Reader now is being evil.</p><p>So, what are my alternatives?</p><ol><li>Do nothing, and rely on <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/google-reader-will-rise-again-as-part-of-google/">the rumor that Reader functionalities will be incorporated in Google+</a>. I'm a Google+ aficionado, and I can see how this move will facilitate the sharing of information and increase the user experience on Google ecosystem;<br /><br /></li><li>Change to another web based RSS reader, where the challenge is to identify which. As noted previously, the API is a very important part of this decision, and I'm glad to see <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/14/baby-steps-replacing-google-reader">Marco's first attempt to have a very quick standard</a> in order to facilitate the migration of the API to other services. Having said that, there are already some moves from several players trying to feel the gap (<a href="http://blog.zite.com/2013/03/14/google-reader-is-dead-so-we-rebuilt-it-for-you-in-zite-in-six-hours/">Zite</a>, <a href="http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/google-reader/">Feedly</a>, <a href="http://blog.digg.com/post/45355701332/were-building-a-reader">digg</a>), and some webpages trying to find out which are the best alternatives (see <a href="http://www.replacereader.com/">here</a> and <a href="http://ginicharts.com/google-reader-alternatives">here</a>);<br /><br /></li><li>Build my own web based RSS reader, using open source code such as <a href="http://tt-rss.org/">tt-rss</a>. The problem with this alternative has to do with the API issue, so I will discard this option for now;<br /><br /></li><li><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/google-reader-alternatives/">Subscribe feeds by email</a>, as suggested by the Copyblogger (one of my feeds). While it is a valid option, it has a lot of drawbacks, which would break my daily workflow, so I'm also discarding this for the time being.</li></ol><p>Do you know any other alternatives?</p>
