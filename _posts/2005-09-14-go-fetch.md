Today, Google released is <a href="http://www.google.com/blogsearch">blog search</a> service. It's a clean and useful service, and it was very funny for me to read other people references to my posts: i don't have trackbacks.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a startup debuted in cyberspace today: <a href="http://www.truveo.com/">truveo</a>. They claim to have a technology which allows them to visual crawl through the Internet. Or, in more dumb words, they have crwalers able to watch movies and other visual content in the Internet, and categorized it. The few experiences I made resulted in impressive results. Try it yourself:<br /><!-- Search Truveo --><br /><FORM method=GET action="http://www.truveo.com/search.php"><TABLE bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td><INPUT type=text name=q size=32 maxlength=255 value="tiger woods"><INPUT type=submit name=btnT value="Truveo Search"><br /></td></tr></TABLE></FORM><br /><!-- Search Truveo -->
