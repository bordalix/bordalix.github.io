title: 'The real hustle'
---

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> the following material could lead you to a addictive behaviour (for 2 to 3 days).</p>

<p>Last Thursday, I went to YouTube and searched for bar tricks, you know, those proposition bets where you bet you can do something, which seems impossible, do it and earn some free beers (like in free software).</p>

<p>While surfing the YouTube search results, I found this BBC series named "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Hustle">The Real Hustle</a>". Is this series, 3 con artists make some scams and extract some money from the marks (aka the victims). The basic idea of the show is to educate viewers about the different types of scams and how to avoid becoming a victim. After the scam, all the victims have their money returned and the con/scam explained.</p>

<p>If you are interested in topics such as social engineering, hacking, card and bar tricks, personal security and such, you will want to watch (all) the videos in YouTube. There are more than 30, with an average of 5 minutes each. The best way to watch them all is to begin by searching for all the movies uploaded by the user <a href="//www.youtube.com/profile?user=kamranakhtar">kamranakthar</a> and then searching for "<a href="//www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+real+hustle&search=Search">The real hustle</a>".</p>

<p>But be aware, once you start, it will be difficult for you to say no to the next one. You have been warned.</p>
