title: "An Inconvenient Truth"
---

<p>Yesterday I went to the cinema and watched the Al Gore <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/">documentary</a>. After, I had mixed feelings about it, so I had to stop and think, and here are my main conclusions:</p><ul><li>If you have political sensibility, you will feel that there is to much of Al Gore's life in the movie. I guess is important to contextualize you in why he's doing this, but it made me feel uncomfortable;</li><li>If you have real concerns (and plan to do something about it) about the global warming problem, you should watch the documentary: it has a lot of new data, and it has the ability to clear up your mind;</li><li>If you need to do presentations and slide shows, than you <b>must</b> watch this documentary. Al Gore presentation skills are awesome, and the looks of the slides are just smashing. I guess I'm allow to say that Steve Jobs is no more the reference on the subject.</li></ul><p>Summarizing, I suggest every one to watch the documentary.</p>
