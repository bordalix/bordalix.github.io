title: "How to fool PageRank"
---

<p>Everytime I look at my Google Analytics statistics, there is <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2006/02/16/food-poisining">this article</a> always on the top 5. That is a bit awkward, since it is an article about some changes I made to my blog: why is it so much important to people to all others articles, all this 8 months?</p><p>My first thought was someone with a heavy traffic site had linked to this particular article, so I went to Google and searched for sites linking to this specific article. There are no sites or soever linking to it. Hummm, that's strange.</p><p>Then I got it! The title of the article is <i>Food Poisining</i>, which has a typo: it should be <i>Food Pois<b>o</b>ning</i>. This is a inocent mistake, and by definition, a common one, so I decided to give it a try, and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=food+poisining&btnG=Search">search in Google for 'Food Poisining'</a>. There it is, in a fine 6th place.</p><p><b>update:</b> The <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2006/02/16/food-poisining">article in question</a> was updated with a message explaining the mistake people are doing, and helping them getting the right way.</p>
