<p>Today, is all about visual:</p>

<ul>
  <li>from a study on biological motion patterns, play with the sliders <a href="http://www.biomotionlab.ca/Demos/BMLwalker.html">here</a> and try to guess who's walking;</li>
  <li>adverstising companies should take a look at the <a href="http://www.io2technology.com/technology/images">heliodisplay</a>, it can really boost any old billboard;</li>
  <li>a truly "fingertips" experience with this new computer interface, TactaPad, and since i'm only linking to visual experiences, watch the demos where <a href="http://tactiva.com/tactapadintromoviesmall.html">one interacts with a Mac</a>, and where <a href="http://tactiva.com/tactadrawmoviesmall.html">one makes some drawings</a>;</li>
  <li>and finally, a <a href="http://www.ifizzle.com/ifizzlepb.html">personal site</a> which looks exactly as is owner powerbook (requires flash player 8).</li>
</ul>
