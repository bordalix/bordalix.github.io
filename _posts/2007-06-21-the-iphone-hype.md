title: 'The iPhone hype'
---

<p>The iPhone will debut a week from tomorrow, and everyone is getting crazy about it. According to a AT&T <a href="http://www.boygeniusreport.com/Documents/iPhonelandlorddoc.pdf">document</a>, Apple and AT&T stores will close at 4:30 pm and then reopen at 6:00 p.m. to "set the store up for iPhone sales and prepare your staff for a successful sales event". The document also refers to "Crowd Controls Devices" that should be in place a week earlier.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Engadget got access to some pictures of the possible <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/20/apple-iphone-dock-revealed-charges-bluetooth-headset-too/">iPhone dock</a>, as of the new <a href="http://cn.engadgetmobile.com/2007/06/15/apple-bluetooth-headset-gets-fcc-go-ahead/">Apple bluetooth headset</a>. Will people be able to buy this tomorrow? Nobody really knows, but everybody is expecting really hard.</p>

<p>The stock market is also going crazy. On one side, it seems highly sceptical about the iPhone launch, with <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=AAPL">Apple shares</a> dropping almost 3% in the last two trading sessions. On the other side, rumours refer to a "40% premium on the Apple share price", and the past days saw the birth of a new rumour: <a href="http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/06/19/could.google.buy.apple/">could Google buy Apple?</a></p>

<p>In the mean time, <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> launched is new Opera mini, the next generation browser for cellphones. For the launch, they mimic the Apple worldwide known "I'm a Mac, I'm a PC" campaign, with a <a href="http://www.operamini.com/beta/video/">comparison between the Opera mini and the iPhone</a>. Come on guys, you can not compare software with hardware, the comparison is truly unfair. Could this mess be a result of the growing <a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/english/business/article1844277.ece">Opera Software internal problems</a>?</p>

<p>As stated by the San Jose Mercury News, "<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_6167770?nclick_check=1"> There's hype, then there's iPhone hype</a>".</p>
