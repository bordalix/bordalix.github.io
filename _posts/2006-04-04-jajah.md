<p>Just found <a href="http://jajah.com/">jajah.com</a>, and brother, this must be the easiest way to use VoIP. Just enter your phone number, and the number you want to call to. Your phone will ring, pick it up, and wait for the other party to answer. That easy, no need for headsets, no download, no installation.</p><p><center><a href="http://jajah.com/"><img src="https://cdn.joaobordalo.com/images/static/blog/jajahform.png"></a></center><br></p><p><a href="http://jajah.com/info/shop/tariffs.asp?l=en">Rates</a> are higher than Skype, and it always will, since they have to pay for two termination fees. And they are not all that competitive, see it for the portuguese market:</p><p><center><table width="200">  <tr bgcolor=#dddddd>    <td>Origin</td>    <td>Destination</td>    <td>Rate</td>  <tr>    <td>Fixed line</td>    <td>Fixed line</td>    <td>&euro;0.03</td>  </tr>  <tr bgcolor=#dddddd>    <td>Fixed line</td>    <td>Mobile</td>    <td>&euro;0.20</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Mobile</td>    <td>Fixed line</td>    <td>&euro;0.19</td>  </tr>  <tr bgcolor=#dddddd>    <td>Mobile</td>    <td>Mobile</td>    <td>&euro;0.35</td>  </tr></table><br></center></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> all <i>in network</i> advantage is lost, so a call between two mobiles belonging to the same operator will also pay &euro;0.35 per minute.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Thanks to <a href="http://paradigma.pt/ja/">Joel</a> for pointing   <a href="http://www.voipstunt.com/">Voipstunt</a>, a VoIP service which allow free calls to land lines.
