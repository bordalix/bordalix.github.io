title: 'The next Apple product?'
---

<p>It's a rumor, so treat it like that, a rumor. MacDailyNews <a href="http://www.macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/rumor_apples_secret_product_is_macbook_touch/">reports</a> the next Apple cutting edge product will be what someone called the MacBook Touch:</p>

<blockquote>Think MacBook screen, possibly a bit smaller, in glass with iPhone-like, but fuller-featured Multi-Touch. Gesture library. Full Mac OS X. This is why they bought P.A. Semi. Possibly with Immersion's haptic tech. Slot-loading SuperDrive. Accelerometer. GPS. Pretty expensive to produce initially, but sold at "low" price that will reduce margins. Apple wants to move these babies. And move they will. This is some sick shit. App Store-compatible, able to run Mac apps, too. By October at the latest.</blockquote>

<p>I was wondering what would be Apple's 2008 breakthrough product. Guess I found it. I recall to see some photos of this, but I lost them, do someone knows where to find some mockups of the possible MacBook Touch?</p>
