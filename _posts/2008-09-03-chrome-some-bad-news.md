title: "Chrome, some bad news"
---

<p><b>Update:</b> Google's <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/update-to-google-chromes-terms-of.html">has changed</a> the Terms of Service for Chrome.</p><p>Everyone is talking about the new Google's browser, coined Chrome. and the idea of launching a <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/index.html">comic book</a> to explain the advantages of Chrome a day before the launch is absolutely brilliant, and surely must be responsible for some of the hype generated along.</p><p>Since there is no Mac version available yet, I still haven't try it, but after reading some posts today, I'm glad I haven't:</p><ul><li>Ryan Narraine, a security evangelist at Kaspersky Lab, <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1843">found out</a> that Chrome has inherited a serious security flaw from the old version of <a href="http://webkit.org">WebKit</a> is based on: by combining a flaw in WebKit with a known Java bug, is possible to an attacker to trick Windows users into launching a Java file in one's computer. Try this <a href="http://raffon.net/research/google/chrome/carpet.html">demo</a> to see the bug working (don't worry, it's only a proof of concept, the Java application that will be installed in your Windows computer will do no harm);</li><li>The other issue has to do with <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html">Chrome Terms of Service</a>, which I believe will be changed in a near future, since point 11.1 states, and I quote, "<i>By submitting, posting or displaying the content you give Google a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute any Content which you submit, post or display on or through, the Services</i>". In my opinion, this make sense when we are talking of services like YouTube and such, but in this case we are talking about a browser, so, by accepting this term, I would be allowing Google to own any content that I would access through the Chrome browser, which is pretty abusive, don't you think?</li></ul><p>In summary, I will wait for the version 1.1 of the browser, and for a change in the Terms of Service before trying it.</p>
