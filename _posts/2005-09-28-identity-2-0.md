title: 'Identity 2.0'
---

<p>An astonishing presentation from Sxip CEO Dick Hardt, about Identity 2.0. Very well contextualized within the <a href="http://web2.wsj2.com/visualizingweb20.htm">Web 2.0 vision</a>, and with great style (marketeers should also take a peek for new presentation ideas). If you have 15 minutes and 13 seconds (plus download time) watch it <a href="http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/">here</a>.</p>
