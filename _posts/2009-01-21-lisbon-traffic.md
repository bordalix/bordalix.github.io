title: "Lisbon traffic"
---

<p><b>Update:</b> <a href="http://cam.aipode.com"> cam.aipode.com</a> has all Brisa's webcams in a neat iPhone interface. Oh, the sweat joy of laziness. Thank you Carlos for the nice job.</p><p>I have to commute to Lisbon every day, through the 25 de Abril bridge. So, every day I need to check the traffic on the bridge, and choose the best alternative to get to <a href="http://excentric.pt/">my job</a>. And since I'm a lazy person, and don't want to spend more than a minute checking the traffic, I've built a page in my blog with all the webcams I need to make my driving decisions. And it's now available to you all: <a href="//joaobordalo.com/pages/traffic/">Lisbon traffic through the 25 de Abril bridge</a>.</p>
