<p>First, <a href="http://pedrofigueiredo.org">Pedro</a> wrote on his blog about the most amazing presentation he has seen this year. Well, knowing Pedro as I know, I had to see it. He is <strong>very</strong> hard to please, so my curiosity was high.</p><p>Guys, you must see this: when someone is able to make a <a href="http://tedblog.typepad.com/tedblog/2006/06/hans_rosling_on.html#">presentation</a> on statistics with the entusiasm of a football game, you just have to love it. It was the first time I saw statistic so live and colorful</p><p>After this, I went to read more about this guy project, <a href="http://gapminder.org/">Gapminder</a>, and I have just found my <i>pro bono</i> project for 2007. I will help in it, that's a fact.</p><p>Third, and while in the Gapminder website, I realize the tool is available for anyone on a Google service. Did you know that Google as a tools.google.com service? And that it's running the <a href="http://tools.google.com/gapminder/">gapminder </a> tool for you to try and explore? Me neither.</p>
