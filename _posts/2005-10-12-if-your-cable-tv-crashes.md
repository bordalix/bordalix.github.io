title: "If your cable tv crashes..."
---

This weekend my cable tv decided to not work anymore, so i had to re-invent my entertainment definition. For a couple of weeks now, i have my adsl link up and running, so i decided to make some web digging and see what was there for me. And here are the results: if you want to watch live tv channels from all over the world (+100), try <a href="http://www.beelinetv.com/">BeelineTV</a>; to the ones who like short funny movies, try <a href="http://www.darlugo.com/">darlugo</a>, <a href="http://www.truveo.com"/>truveo</a> or <a href="http://video.google.com/">google video</a>; if you want to watch some old movies or tv series (remember Flash Gordon?) you can always take a peek at <a href="http://emol.org/movies/">Emol</a> and download some, since they are copyright free; and if don't give a damn to copyright, and don't care for video quality, go to <a href="http://www.divxcrawler.com/">divxcrawler</a> and download some of last month blockbusters. After this, who needs cable tv after all?<br /><br /><b>Update:</b> my cable tv is up again, so i will be able to watch the soccer game tonight. Yes, there's a reason to have cable tv, after all.<br /><br /><b>Update2:</b> just found a post <a href="http://www.deny.de/ghacks/?p=13">here</a> on using Google to find for open index webpages with movies. Just click <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=-inurl%3Ahtm+-inurl%3Ahtml+-inurl%3Aphp+intitle%3A%E2%80%9Dindex+of%E2%80%9D+%28mpg%7Cavi%7Cwmv%29&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">here</a> to see some results provided by Google.
