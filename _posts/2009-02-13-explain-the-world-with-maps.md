title: "Explain the world with maps"
---

<p>After <a href="//joaobordalo.com/articles/2006/08/03/bread-crumbs-mind-the-gap">Gapminder</a> (back in 2006), I've just found <a href="http://www.uuorld.com/">UUworld</a>, a free tool for Mac (Pro costs $49):</p><blockquote><p>UUorld (pronounced "world") provides an immersive mapping environment, high-quality data, and critical analysis tools. Great explanations are unfortunately scarce, but UUorld makes them easier to achieve through interactive four-dimensional maps</p></blockquote><p>Very interesting for social, geographic and demographic studies.</p>
