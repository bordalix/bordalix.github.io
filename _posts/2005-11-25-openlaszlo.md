title: "OpenLaszlo"
---

From <a href="httpt://www.ajaxian.com">Ajaxian</a> I found that <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org">OpenLaszlo</a> added XMLHttpRequest in is version 3.1. I didn't know what OpenLaszlo was, so I decided to take a peek: <br /><blockquote>The OpenLaszlo platform allows developers to create applications with the rich user interface capabilities of desktop client software and the instantaneous no-download Web deployment of HTML. These applications run on all leading Web browsers on all leading desktop operating systems from a single XML code base.</blockquote><br />Since a video is better than a thousand images, watch this 3m <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/img/laszlo-basics.mov">video</a> (2MB) and take your own conclusions.
