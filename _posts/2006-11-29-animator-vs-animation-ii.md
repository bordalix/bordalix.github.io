title: 'Animator vs Animation II'
---

<p>The saga, one of the best animations I've seen ever. If you are reading this through a RSS reader, come on in, we have a embeded video to show.</p>

<p><strong>Update2:</strong> Following a suggestion from <a href="http://paradigma.pt/ja">Joel</a>, here are the direct links for the two videos: <a href="http://www.atomfilms.com/af/content/animator_vs_animation">Animator vs Animation</a> and <a href="http://www.atomfilms.com/af/content/animator_vs_animation_2">Animator vs Animation II</a>. The videos have better quality in the <a href="http://www.atomfilms.com/">Atom Films website</a>, but you have to pay the price of watching some publicity.<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="//youtube.com/">Youtube</a> decided to drop the video, so I had to browse for a while to find it in another "share your videos" service. So, here it is again, now from <a href="http://dailymotion.com">DailyMotion</a>:</p>
