<p><a href="http://www.akamai.com/">Akamai</a> launched a <a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/visualizing_akamai.html">new service</a> that allow anyone to check the web behaviour at any given moment. With great graphics, one can see the performance of the Net on a given moment, and check for usage indices for the last 24 hours. Here are the 6 graphics delivered:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/dataviz1.html">Real-Time Web Monitor</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/dataviz2.html">Network Performance Comparison</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/dataviz3.html">Visualize the Akamai network</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/nui/retail/index.html">Net Usage Index: Retail</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/nui/news/index.html">Net Usage Index: News</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/nui/music/index.html">Net Usage Index: Music</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I know the service is really new, so it doesn't have data from the past. But, with more data, I think this could became a great tool to watch for trends, identify virus attacks and for better bandwidth management. Over all, it's a great job.</p>
