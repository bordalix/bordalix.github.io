title: 'Apple, please open the iPhone'
---

<p>Dear Steve, you should sell the iPhones as you sell your computers: like an open plataform where anyone can install whatever application they want, with full responsability and without your paternal control.</p>

<p>This way, you will sell millions of iPhones worldwide, and will be doing what you do best: selling state-of-the-art hardware running a gorgeous, user friendly operating system.</p>

<p>Trying to gain from the mobile operators is buying a war you don't want (or need) to. Trying to gain from the developers community by restricting the free flow of creativity is wrong, and against the values of the Apple brand.</p>

<p>So, please, don't be greedy, change your mind, or <a href="http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200803132020DOWJONESDJONLINE001129_FORTUNE5.htm">they will force you</a>.
