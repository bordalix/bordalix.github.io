title: "Impressive collaborative music"
---

<p><a href="http://www.inbflat.net/">In Bb 2.0</a> is a collaborative music and spoken word project conceived by <a href="http://www.scienceforgirls.net/bio.html">Darren Solomon</a> from <a href="http://www.scienceforgirls.net/">Science for Girls</a>, and developed with contributions from users. 20 different YouTube videos embed in the same page, each with one instrument playing a tune, but where harmony is very well achieved. The videos can be played simultaneously - the soundtracks will work together, and the mix can be adjusted with the individual volume sliders. And you can combine any choice of instruments and play a different music each time, worth a try.</p>
