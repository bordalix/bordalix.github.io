title: 'What is Nostr'
---

Nostr stands for "Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays". It is a decentralized social network protocol that aims to create a censorship-resistant and user-empowered alternative to existing social media platforms.

Key features of Nostr:

- **Decentralized**: Nostr does not have a central server or authority. Instead, it relies on a network of relays that store and distribute messages. This makes it difficult to censor or shut down the network.
- **User-empowered**: Users have complete control over their own data and can choose which relays they trust. They can also self-host their own relays to ensure that their data is not subject to third-party control.
- **Censorship-resistant**: Nostr's decentralized nature makes it very difficult to censor messages. Even if some relays are censored, there will always be other relays that are available to store and distribute messages.
- **Open protocol**: Nostr is an open protocol, which means that anyone can build applications on top of it. This has led to the development of a variety of Nostr clients, each with its own unique features.

Besides social networking, Nostr has other potential use cases, including:

- **News feeds and RSS feeds**: Nostr could be used to create a decentralized and censorship-resistant alternative to traditional news feeds and RSS feeds.
- **Microblogging and status updates**: Nostr could be used to create a decentralized and censorship-resistant alternative to microblogging platforms like Twitter.
- **File sharing and distributed file storage**: Nostr could be used to create a decentralized and censorship-resistant alternative to file-sharing platforms like Dropbox and Google Drive.
- **Secure messaging and encrypted communication**: Nostr could be used to create a decentralized and censorship-resistant alternative to secure messaging platforms like Signal and WhatsApp.
- **Identity management and self-sovereign identity**: Nostr could be used to create a decentralized and censorship-resistant alternative to traditional identity management systems.
- **Decentralized applications (dApps)**: Nostr could be used to build a wide variety of decentralized applications (dApps).
