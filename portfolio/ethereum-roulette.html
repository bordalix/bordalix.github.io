    <h2>Full story</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Motivation</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to learn more about developing smart contracts, and since I learn by building stuff, so I decided to
      implement a casino roulette, with the business logic being implemented in Solidity, the language of choice to
      develop smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frontend is a regular html page, with the web3 javascript library, which makes it possible to interact with
      the Ethereum blockchain via javascript. The web3 library is injected in the page by the Chrome extension Metamask.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How to play</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ll need to have the
      <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a>
      Chrome extension installed, have an account on the ropsten network, have some ether and
      <a href="http://ethereum-roulette.ga">access the dapp</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Every bet has a fixed amount of 0.01 ether (around €6) and you can bet by clicking on the board. The roulette just
      accepts a bet when has sufficient funds to pay for it and every other active bet.
    </p>
    <p>Different people can be playing at the same time.</p>
    <p>
      One of the players will click the “Spin Wheel” button, which will generate a random number and all bets will be
      dealt with accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a player wins a bet, the payout is credited on his personal account. The player can, at any moment, click the
      “Cash out” button and receive their winnings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What you’ll need</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ganache: you can download a self-contained prebuilt Ganache binary for your platform of choice using the
        "Download" button on the
        <a href="http://truffleframework.com/ganache/">Ganache website</a>. After, run it and keep it running, this will
        deploy a private Ethereum network on your machine, port 7545
      </li>
      <li>
        npm: follow
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm">this instructions</a>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>How to lunch the ethereum roulette on your machine</strong>
