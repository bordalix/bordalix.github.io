    <h2>👾 Arkade Wallet</h2>
    <p>Arkade Wallet is the entry-point to the Arkade ecosystem—a self-custodial Bitcoin wallet delivered as a lightweight Progressive Web App (installable on mobile or desktop in seconds, no app-store gatekeepers).</p>
    <p>Built around the open-source ARK protocol, it speaks natively to any arkd instance, letting you create, send, and receive Virtual Transaction Outputs (VTXOs) for instant, off-chain pre-confirmations and batched, fee-efficient on-chain settlement.</p>
