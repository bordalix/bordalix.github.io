    <h2>Full story</h2>
    <p>I believe there's a huge gap between the ease of use of Wallet of Satoshi and the self-custody of Phoenix. To minimize this gap, I created a new web app, a wallet that has the self-custody of Phoenix and is easy to use as WoS.</p>

    <p>Helm is a Liquid wallet that uses Boltz submarine swaps to disguise itself as a Lightning wallet that even your grandma can use.</p>

    <p>But it has a cost.</p>

    <p>All transactions must go on the Liquid chain and also Boltz must earn something for the service they provide, so there are fees to be paid:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The minimum cost for sending a payment is around 200 sats;</li>
      <li>The average cost for sending
        <strong>or receiving</strong>
        a payment is around 400 sats plus 0.1% of the amount;</li>
      <li>Transactions between Helm wallets donâ€™t pay Boltz fees but can take up to 1 minute to complete;</li>
      <li>Amounts are limited between 1.000 and 25.000.000 sats.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can try it (testnet if you want) on
      <a href="https://helm-wallet.pages.dev/">https://helm-wallet.pages.dev/</a>
    </p>

    <p>Code is available at
      <a href="https://github.com/bordalix/helm-wallet">https://github.com/bordalix/helm-wallet</a>
    </p>

    <p>The web app is completely independent, no server required. You can clone it, build it and run it from your own computer. Everything runs on the browser.</p>

    <p>Critics and suggestions are welcome.</p>
