          <p><strong>What is AppCoins?</strong></p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://appcoins.io/">AppCoins</a> is an open and distributed
            protocol for App Stores using blockchain technology and smart contracts.
            Serving over 200 million users, AppCoin (APPC) tokens are the new native
            currency of the app economy that ensures trust without intermediaries.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Aptoide</strong></p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.aptoide.com/">Aptoide</a> is an alternative marketplace
            for mobile applications which runs on the Android operating system.
            In Aptoide, unlike the default Google Play Store, there is not a unique and
            centralized store. Instead, each user manages their own store.
          </p>
          <p><strong>The problem</strong></p>
          <p>
            Ethereum technology has a few constraints, like the processing time and
            transaction errors in the network, creating so much friction in the checkout
            funnels that is barely impossible for the user to do an In-App Purchases or
            to be reawarded in a User Acquisition campaign.
          </p>
          <p><strong>The solution</strong></p>
          <p>
            After researching different Ethereum layer 2 technologies, the team chose to
            fork Micro-raiden’s smart contracts to become the base of the payment channel.
          </p>
          <p>
            What is a blockchain payment channel? If two parties (app store and end-user,
            for instance) foresee that they will do several transactions together, they can
            leverage the trust of the blockchain without the need of using the distributed
            ledger to keep track of every transaction. In a payment channel, the user
            “deposits” a fixed amount (e.g. 10 APPC) that will remain locked into this payment
            channel and every time the user wants to pay for something she can use part of
            that balance, sending a “proof” with the updated balance of the payment channel.
            Those transactions are done off-chain and don’t encounter the time and fee
            limitations of the Ethereum network.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, by itself, this solution breaks the assumption that developers
            should be able to validate the interactions between users and their apps
            without the need to trust any third party because these transactions are
            done off-chain, i.e. outside the Blockchain.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text_column right">
          <p><strong>Merkle trees</strong></p>
          <p>
            In order to solve this issue, we started consolidating these off-chain
            transactions in the Blockchain and have them verifiable by developers.
            Periodically, for each developer’s wallet, we gather all the transactions
            and compute a Merkle Tree. Merkle Trees are a nice and affordable way of
            representing large portions of data and providing a proof that someone
            holds that data. Once a Merkle Tree is computed for a given developer’s
            wallet, its root hash is sent to the Blockchain coupled with the developer’s
            wallet. If the developer wants to validate the transactions they have in his
            wallet, the developer can either ask our API for all the transactions and
            compute the Merkle Tree himself. In addition, he can store the transactions
            himself and use them to compute the Merkle Tree. Then, he can validate that
            the root hash sent by our system to the Blockchain is correctly computed.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Blockchain explorer</strong></p>
          <p>
            But for developers to be able to verify this off-chain transactions,
            there's a missing piece in the puzzle, a Blockchain explorer. Think
            Etherscan, but for AppCoins.

          <p>Very proud of being part of this.</p>
