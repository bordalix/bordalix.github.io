    <p>
      <strong>The problem:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Imagine you are in Portugal, you want to go surfing, but you don't know where the best waves are.</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
    <p>
      Well, you open your surf guide, see what surf spots are near enough, search for a beachcam on that spot, and after
      some thorough evaluation, you finally decide where to go. Now it's time to search for the spot on Google Maps, and
      get some directions.
    </p>
    <p>Wouldn't be great if there was a simpler way of doing all this?</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Well, there is.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      That's why I made
      <a href="https://wheretosurftoday.com">https://wheretosurftoday.com</a>
      some time ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>And how exactly it solves the problem?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>After you give authorization to the website to access your location, you will get:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>133 spots covering all the portuguese coast</li>
      <li>Access to the beachcam link</li>
      <li>Specific information about the spot</li>
      <li>Direct links to Google Maps</li>
      <li>Every spot has its own forecast</li>
      <li>Forecast in 3 hours slots</li>
      <li>Surf score for each spot and slot</li>
      <li>Search based on geolocation</li>
      <li>Navigate using the built in map</li>
      <li>No sign up, no ads, no data gathering</li>
      <li>
        Easier to type domain,
