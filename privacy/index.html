  <h5>Privacy policy summary</h5>
  <p>
    We respect your right for privacy, which is why all personal data will be processed in accordance with European
    laws. For your convenience all details will be explained below, which, for a better understanding, consist of:
  </p>
  <p>
    All data provided to us is processed in order to improve our services. We also remind you that none of this
    information will be shared with any affiliated companies nor third party services.
  </p>
  <p>
    For statistical reasons we may, however, collect anonymous data regarding the use of our platforms, as well as basic
    technological information about your device and internet connection.
  </p>
  <h5>Basic Terminology of Data Protection</h5>
  <p>
    Personal data is any information relating to an identified/identifiable individual. Examples of personal data
    include your email, as well as other types of information associated with identifiable information, such as the
    accounts on your mobile devices. Personal information processing means any operation carried out with the use of
    personal data, such as its collection, organization, storage, distribution or disposal.
  </p>
  <h5>Regarding the personal data we collect</h5>
  <p>
    We receive numerous types of information for use in our platforms. By agreeing to the use of our services (namely
    the use of our platform), you also agree for the information that is shared with us to be stored in our database for
    user recognition and to ensure we provide our services in the most correct ways. We also store data when you contact
    us, for instance: when you send us an email, in order for us to provide the necessary assistance to answer your
    questions. We may also use anonymous and aggregated information on these same inquiries in order to improve our
    services.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, we store technical information about your device and internet connection, as well as information regarding
    your operating system, browser version, IP address, cookies and other unique factors. However, we may only collect
    this information for security purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regarding cookies and other locally collected data, we use a variety of technologies to recognize you as a user of
    our platform. For instance, we use cookies and local storage to enhance user experience. We may also store anonymous
    identifying information located locally on devices unable to use cookies.
  </p>
  <h5>How do we use data?</h5>
  <p>
    We use personal data to provide you with a service, to develop and improve our services, to comprehend market
    trends, to anticipate future behavior and to prevent abuse. Details are as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>a) Market trend analysis</b><br />
    We analyze data to understand current market trends and to improve and customize our platform. Such analysis may be
    done directly by us.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>b) Improve our platform</b><br />
    We use data to improve our services, for instance by trying to make our platform as user-friendly as possible. We
    may also, for example, register all steps taken by the user (pageviews, clicks, etc), related to our platform, to
    understand if there are certain elements that may be perceived as confusing by our users. The analysis is usually
    performed through the use of data at an anonymous and/or aggregated level, and it may be necessary to use certain
    identifiable information to provide technical support and to understand how each individual uses our services.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>c) Preventing Abuse</b><br />
    We use data to restrict any form of abuse of our services, such as fraudulent activities, cyber attacks, spamming
    and unauthorized logins, among other actions which are prohibited by European law.
  </p>
  <h5>How we may use your data</h5>
  <p>
    We will not share, sell, convey or otherwise disclose the shared data, except for the purposes mentioned in this
    privacy policy, for legal reasons or after you have given your explicit consent.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there is suspicion of any illegal activity in connection with our services, the data may be disclosed to the
    public authorities subject to a judicial or administrative decision.
  </p>
  <p>
    IP addresses and other anonymous data may be shared with third party acknowledgment devices to prevent unauthorized
    logins and fraudulent behavior. We may use, for instance, data that is stored (for instance: on our server, operated
    by a third party) or use a third party to make a payment. Such data processors are subject to specific data
    processing agreements as well as national and European regulation, which protects the confidentiality, integrity and
    use of this data.
  </p>
  <h5>Retention of personal data</h5>
  <p>
    Personal data will only be stored for as long as it is strictly necessary to the purposes of the services we
    provide. You may, at any time, request the deletion of this data from our platform, using our contact page. The
    information will be deleted after a quarantine period, unless the information is required for statistical purposes,
    to provide a service that you may still want to pursue/acquire or if the law requires that data to be kept for a
    specific period of time.
  </p>
  <h5>Quarantine period when canceling the service agreement</h5>
  <p>
    If you choose to cancel our services, the data will be set for quarantine for 90 days. After that period all
    personal data will be deleted or anonymised. This data will be securely archived and encrypted. It will only be made
    available to legal entities in response to legal requests, if under the applicable law we are required to do so.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the aforementioned retention period has ceased, all personal identifiable data is removed from all our
    records. However, we reserve the right to use this same information for statistical purposes, in compliance with the
    personal data protection law.
  </p>
  <h5>Cookies</h5>
  <p>
    Cookies are information stored in the browser. They are created when the user's browser loads a website, which then
    sends data to the browser, which stores it. Whenever the user accesses the same website, the browser accesses that
    same data and sends it to the website's server.
  </p>
  <p>
    You agree with the use of cookies when using our services. If you wish to withdraw your consent, you may do so by
    changing your browser settings. However, this action may cause you to lose access to certain functions.
  </p>
  <h5>Updates to this policy</h5>
  <p>
    This privacy policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes that may be made both to our platforms
    and/or policies. If we update this policy, a new policy will be posted on our website within 5 days after these
    changes are implemented. The start date for our current policy is February 23th, 2022.
