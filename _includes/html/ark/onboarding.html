<h3>Onboarding</h3>
<p>
  The first step is for Alice to lift her coins. This is an <u>atomic</u> swap where she will give up a UTXO (+ fees) to
  receive a <strong>VTXO</strong> from the ASP at the same time. This <strong>VTXO</strong> will be inside the next
  <strong>Pool transaction</strong>.
</p>
<p>In this example, Alice, Bob, Carol and Dave are "lifting" UTXOs to Ark:</p>
<script type="text/typogram">
  {% include txt/ark2/onboarding.txt %}
</script>
<p>In order to be trustless:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alice sending funds to ASP and the ASP creating the VTXO needs to be an atomic operation:</li>
  <li>This atomicity is achieved using <strong>Anchored transactions</strong></li>
  <li>Alice needs a way to exit the Ark without ASP's permission</li>
</ul>

    <p>
      Alice now wants to enter the Ark, so he must use a process called lifting, which is an atomic two-way peg
      mechanism that doesn't require trust. Lifting lets users lift their onchain UTXOs off the chain for a 1:1 VTXO.
      Users can unilaterally redeem a VTXO for an onchain UTXO without asking for ASP cooperation.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <!-- #1 -->
      <li>
        Alice creates a <strong>Funding transaction</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>adds any segwit output as an input (<u>must be segwit</u>)</li>
          <li>adds output locked by <em>(Alice + ASP) or (ASP in 1 month)</em></li>
          <li>sends it to ASP, <u>not signed</u></li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <!-- #2 -->
      <li>
        Alice receives a <u>signed</u> <strong>Redeem transaction</strong> from the ASP:
        <ul>
          <li>spends <strong>Funding transaction</strong> (1) via <em>Alice + ASP</em></li>
          <li>has output locked to <em>(Alice + ASP) or (Alice in 24h)</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <script type="text/typogram">
        {% include txt/ark2/lifting2.txt %}

      <!-- #3 -->
      <li>
        Alice <u>signs</u> and broadcasts <strong>Funding transaction</strong> (1)
        <ul>
          <li>
            Is now safe for Alice to broadcast his funding transaction because now she can leave anytime with
            <strong>Redeem transaction</strong> (2) spending <em>Alice in 24h</em>, i.e. Alice will be able to get her
            funds back in 24 hours.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <!-- #4 -->
      <li>ASP (with Alice) prepares next <strong>Pool transaction</strong></li>
      <script type="text/typogram">
        {% include txt/ark2/lifting4.txt %}
      </script>

      <!-- #5 -->
      <li>
        Alice creates a <strong>Forfeit transaction</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>spends from <strong>Redeem transaction</strong> (2) via <em>Alice + ASP</em></li>
          <li>adds connector output from <strong>Pool transaction</strong> (4) as input</li>
          <li><u>signs</u> (commits all inputs with SIGHASH_ALL) and sends it to the ASP</li>

        {% include txt/ark2/lifting5.txt %}

      <!-- #6 -->
      <li>ASP broadcasts <strong>Pool transaction</strong> (4)</li>

      <!-- #7 -->
      <li>
        Alice has now a VTXO
        <ul>
          <li>A VTXO is very similar to a <strong>Redeem transaction</strong></li>
        </ul>

    <p>So far, Alice polluted onchain by funding an address, and the ASP by claiming funds from that address.</p>
    <p>Further steps from here will be footprint minimal.</p>

    <p><strong>Adversarial scenarios</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Alice broadcasts <strong>Funding transaction</strong> (1) but ASP never responds:<br />
        Alice broadcasts <strong>Redeem transaction</strong> (2) and get his funds back in 24 hours<br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Alice broadcasts <strong>Redeem transaction</strong> (2) after <strong>Pool transaction</strong> (3):<br />
        ASP broadcasts <strong>Forfeit transaction</strong> (5) and claims Alice's funds<br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        ASP doesn't wait for confirmation of <strong>Funding transaction</strong> (1) before broadcasting
        <strong>Pool transaction</strong> (4):<br />
        Alice will double spend his original UTXO, making the funding transaction invalid and them spending the VTXO,
        thus stealing the ASP<br /><br />
