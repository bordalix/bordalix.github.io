<h2 id="pool">Pool transaction</h2>
<p>
  The ASP makes a special transaction, called <strong>Pool transaction</strong>, where it mixes UTXOs from many users
  (among other things) and creates a <strong>Shared UTXO</strong> as well as many offchain <strong>VTXOs</strong> for
  each of those users.

    <h3>Pool transaction</h3>
    <p>
      The ASP places one (or more) input(s) to its pool transaction to supply funds to the shared UTXO, connectors
      output, change output, and transaction fees.
    </p>
    <script type="text/typogram">
      {% include txt/ark/pooltx1.txt %}
    </script>
    <h3>Shared output (aka Shared UTXO)</h3>
    <p>The shared UTXO is locked by 2 taproot leaves:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A multisig <em>n-of-n</em>, where n is the number of participants in the transaction.</li>
      <li>The other leaf, <em>ASP in 1 month</em>, allows the ASP to spend it alone after 1 month.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In order to be trustless, before signing the pool transaction Alice needs a way to unilaterally get their funds
      back. To achieve this, the ASP builds and signs a binary tree of transactions and shares them with each
      participant.
    </p>
    <p>Each leaf on this tree represents a VTXO:</p>
    <script type="text/typogram">
      {% include txt/ark/pooltx2.txt %}
    </script>
    <p>
      In the example above, Alice can broadcast anytime <em>tx1 => tx2 => tx4</em> to receive their funds back.<br />
      For comparison, Bob will need to broadcast <em>tx1 => tx2 => tx5</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Since <em>tx1:1 => tx2:1 => tx4</em> (the VTXO) have no fees, Alice will need to add an extra transaction to pay
        for all the fees (see <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/cpfp/" target="_blank">CPFP</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
        The number of transactions on this branches will be equal to <em>log2(n) + 1</em>, where n = number of
        participants
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For clarity, VTXOs will be represented like this:</p>
    <script type="text/typogram">
      {% include txt/ark/pooltx3.txt %}
    </script>
  </div>
