<h2 id="round">Round transaction</h2>
<p>
  The ASP makes a special transaction, called
  <strong>Round transaction</strong>, where it mixes UTXOs from many users    
  (among other things) and creates a
  <strong>Shared UTXO</strong>
  as well as many offchain
  <strong>VTXOs</strong>
  for    
  each of those users.

    <h3>Round transaction</h3>
    <p>
      The ASP places one (or more) input(s) to its round transaction to supply funds to the shared UTXO, connectors    
      output, change output, and transaction fees.
    </p>
    <script type="text/typogram">
      {% include txt/ark/roundtx1.txt %}
    </script>
    <h3>Shared output (aka Shared UTXO)</h3>
    <p>The shared UTXO is locked by 2 taproot leaves:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A multisig
        <em>n-of-n</em>, where n is the number of participants in the transaction.</li>
      <li>The other leaf,
        <em>ASP in 1 month</em>, allows the ASP to spend it alone after 1 month.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In order to be trustless, before signing the round transaction Alice needs a way to unilaterally get their funds    
      back. To achieve this, the ASP builds and signs a binary tree of transactions and shares them with each
      participant.
    </p>
    <p>Each leaf on this tree represents a VTXO:</p>
    <script type="text/typogram">
      {% include txt/ark/roundtx2.txt %}
    </script>
    <p>
      In the example above, Alice can broadcast anytime
      <em>tx1 => tx2 => tx4</em>
      to receive their funds back.<br/>
      For comparison, Bob will need to broadcast
      <em>tx1 => tx2 => tx5</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Since
        <em>tx1:1 => tx2:1 => tx4</em>
        (the VTXO) have no fees, Alice will need to add an extra transaction to pay    
        for all the fees (see
        <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/cpfp/" target="_blank">CPFP</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
        The number of transactions on this branches will be equal to
        <em>log2(n) + 1</em>, where n = number of    
        participants
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For clarity, VTXOs will be represented like this:</p>
    <script type="text/typogram">
      {% include txt/ark/roundtx3.txt %}
    </script>
