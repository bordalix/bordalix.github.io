<h2>Onboarding</h2>
<p>
  The first step is for Alice to lift her coins. This is an <u>atomic</u> swap where she will give up a UTXO (+ fees) to
  receive a virtual UTXO (aka VTXO) from the ASP at the same time. The ASP makes a special transaction, called pool
  transaction (aka Pool Tx), where it mixes UTXOs from many users (among other things) and creates a shared UTXO as well
  as many offchain VTXOs for each of those users including one for Alice.
</p>
<p>In this example, Alice, Bob, Carol and Dave are "lifting" 0.01 BTC each to Ark:</p>
<script type="text/typogram">
  {% include txt/ark/onboarding0.txt %}
</script>
<p>In order to be trustless:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alice sending funds to ASP and the ASP creating the VTXO needs to be atomic</li>
  <li>Alice needs a way to exit the Ark without ASP's permission</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Pool transaction</h3>
    <p>
      The ASP places one (or more) input(s) to its pool transaction to supply funds to the shared UTXO output,
      connectors output, change output, and transaction fees.
    </p>
    <script type="text/typogram">
      {% include txt/ark/pooltx1.txt %}
    </script>
    <p>The shared UTXO output is a UTXO locked by 2 taproot leaves:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A multisig <em>n-of-n</em>, where n is the number of participants in the transaction.</li>
      <li>The other leaf, <em>pk(ASP) && older(4 weeks)</em>, allows the ASP to spend it alone after 4 weeks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In order to be trustless, before signing the pool transaction Alice needs a way to unilaterally get their funds
      back. To achieve this, the ASP builds and signs a binary tree of transactions and shares them with each
      participant.
    </p>
    <p>Each leaf on this tree represents a VTXO:</p>
    <script type="text/typogram">
      {% include txt/ark/pooltx2.txt %}
    </script>
    <p>
      In the example above, Alice's VTXO will be <em>tx1:1 => tx2:1 => tx4</em> that she can broadcast anytime to
      receive their funds back. For comparison, Bob's VTXO will be <em>tx1:1 => tx2:0 => tx5</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Since <em>tx1:1 => tx2:1 => tx4</em> (the VTXO) have no fees, Alice will need to add an extra transaction to pay
        for all the fees (see <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/cpfp/" target="_blank">CPFP</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
        The number of transactions on this branches will be equal to <em>log2(n) + 1</em>, where n = number of
        participants
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For clarity, VTXOs will be represented like this:</p>
    <script type="text/typogram">
      {% include txt/ark/pooltx3.txt %}
    </script>

    <h3>Lifting</h3>
    <p>
      Frank now wants to enter the Ark, so he must use a process called lifting, which is an atomic two-way peg
      mechanism that doesn't require trust. Lifting lets users lift their onchain utxos off the chain for a 1:1 VTXO.
      Users can unilaterally redeem a VTXO for an onchain utxo without asking for ASP cooperation.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Frank sends 0.01 BTC to <em>pk(F) && (older(4 weeks) || pk(ASP))</em> (aka funding address):</li>
      <script type="text/typogram">
        {% include txt/ark/onboarding1.txt %}
      </script>
      <li>
        Frank creates an PSBT and adds as input the output of funding transaction. We will call this transaction the
        sweep transaction, since it will allow the ASP to sweep the funds:
      </li>
      <script type="text/typogram">
        {% include txt/ark/onboarding2.txt %}
      </script>
      <li>Frank passes this PSBT to the ASP</li>
      <li>ASP places one input to PSBT, the "connector output" from the next pool transaction:</li>
      <script type="text/typogram">
        {% include txt/ark/onboarding4.txt %}
      </script>
      <li>ASP places one output to PSBT, <em>pk(ASP)</em>, a singlesig output that sweeps all money to itself:</li>
      <script type="text/typogram">
        {% include txt/ark/onboarding5.txt %}
      </script>
      <li>
        ASP passes PSBT to Frank and both sign the PSBT and keep this transaction private. This transaction is not valid
        yet, since the connector's outpoint context does not exist yet;
      </li>
      <li>ASP signs the pool transaction and broadcast it:</li>
      <script type="text/typogram">
        {% include txt/ark/onboarding7.txt %}
      </script>
      <li>
        ASP can now claim 0.01 BTC from the funding transaction by revealing the descendant transaction of connectors
        output. The ASP should claim this before four weeks or else Frank could double spend it. Don't forget the
        funding transaction is locked to: <em>pk(F) && (older(4weeks) || pk(ASP))</em>.
      </li>
      <script type="text/typogram">
        {% include txt/ark/onboarding8.txt %}
      </script>
      <li>
        Frank now has a 0.01 BTC worth UTXO representation as a descendant of the shared UTXO output (a VTXO). To avoid
        double spending, the ASP will not allow Frank to use its <em>VTXO</em> before the funding transaction is
        confirmed:
      </li>
      <script type="text/typogram">
        {% include txt/ark/onboarding9.txt %}
      </script>
    </ol>
    <p>So far, Frank polluted onchain by funding an address, and the ASP by claiming funds from that address.</p>
    <p>Further steps from here will be footprint minimal.</p>

      <summary>Adversarial scenarios</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Franks send 0.01 BTC but ASP never responds</strong><br />
          Franks will be able to get his funds back in 4 weeks<br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ASP never broadcasts pool transaction</strong><br />
          Franks will be able to get his funds back in 4 weeks<br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ASP doesn't wait for confirmation of funding address before broadcasting pool tx</strong><br />
          Franks will double spend his original UTXO, making the funding transaction invalid and them spending the VTXO,
          thus stealing the ASP<br /><br />
